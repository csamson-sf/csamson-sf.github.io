Let's now cross live to London to discuss this with Piers Corbyn. He's an astrophysicist and also founder of Weather Action. Good to have you. Thanks very much indeed for joining us live there in London. So what we're seeing here is a drastic change in climate, aren't we? Well, climate has always been changing, but this has nothing to do with man. In fact, we predicted that there would be extreme heat in East Europe and Russia this summer, and it's caused by a certain circulation pattern. CO2 does not cause circulation patterns. What causes those is a combination of solar activity and the state of the phases of the moon. Hang on, Piers. Excuse me just a minute. You say this isn't caused by man. How come the reporting this heatwave is recognised as the worst in a thousand years of recorded history in Russia? And surely man has got something to do with this, hasn't he? No, nothing to do with it. The only connection is man is here at the same time as the sun and the moon are doing things. You see, a very similar situation happened about 132 years ago, where there was the same sun, earth, lunar magnetic states. There was a heatwave in Russia and there were also floods in Pakistan, as now. And in the previous few years, there were also floods in the English summers, also 132 years ago. So these things are dictated by solar activity in the moon. They're nothing to do with mankind, and those who say that are just trying to make money out of it. But are we not going to see this again next year, the year on? I mean, it's only quite recent. That's a very interesting question. These things do come in bursts, and we're working on that very question, those forecasts. We did say there would be a series of wet summers in England, for example, which we've had. Now, will there be a series of these very hot summers in Russia? We don't know. We'd have to work on that. But I assure you, it's nothing to do with carbon dioxide. And if you stop driving around Moscow, it won't affect next summer one jot. Well, how come then so many climate change scientists disagree with you, and they get so much support for what they say? They're on a gravy train, for heaven's sake.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

He's changing the arguments. If you've heard him talk about climate change, I just saw him slay a couple of people who were triggered into cognitive dissonance, because he's the first person who can explain it well. The climate change agenda is a hoax, is what I said. And what I mean by that is that the temperature-related or climate-related disaster death rate, tornadoes, hurricanes, heat wave, fires, the number of deaths over the last 100 years is down by 98%. For every 100 people that died of a climate-related disaster in 1920, that number is two people today. That fact is not disputed. The reason why is more abundant and plentiful access to fossil fuels. More people die today still, eight times as many more people die of cold temperatures rather than warm ones. The right answer to all temperature-related deaths is more abundant access to fossil fuels. The earth is covered by more green surface area coverage today than it was half a century or a century ago, because carbon dioxide is plant food. So these are hard facts, not disputed, but that you don't hear from the climate agenda. Hold on, Vivek, wouldn't the reduction in deaths be more related to technology that's allowed us to warn people and to get people out of the way of danger? And there's nothing to do with fossil fuels. Technology powered by fossil fuels. Technology powered by fossil fuels, and that's my point. So I favor adaptation. I favor climate mastery. Look at the likes of what Bjorn Lomborg to Alex Epstein to even Steve Koonin, a physicist who served in the Obama administration. I've read all their books cover to cover. I think the reality is the climate change policies are going to be more hostile to human flourishing than actual threats posed by climate change itself. Other people have taken the same approach, but he explains it in a way that that the people understand it for the first time. And you're watching heads explode as they try to wrap their head around the fact that when you look at the net argument, it's just a killer argument. It just crushes the other side.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

It looks like it's no longer settled. What happened? Well, there's a series of three new peer-reviewed papers published in major prestigious scientific journals just over the last month or so. And taken together, they completely undermine the alleged scientific consensus on man-made global warming. One of them found that about 40% of the observed warming can be explained away using the urban heat island effect. So to try to summarize that, basically a lot of these thermometers were put out there in an open field in a rural area. A city was built up around it, and so it gets warmer. Obviously not because there's global warming, but because there's a city around the thermometer. The rest of the warming, they found, can be easily explained using changes in solar activity that NASA has been tracking meticulously for many decades. And so right now, these are in the peer-reviewed literature. And instead of responding to this, you've got the climate establishment going on Twitter and saying these guys are basically poo-poo heads and clowns and deniers. So at this point, you wonder, do they have a scientific response? Because if they did, they would probably write a peer-reviewed paper to refute the ones that just undermine their claims. Well, how did they get them? It's hard to get a peer-reviewed paper when it comes to these topics. What was the kind of hole in the wall that brought this about, so to speak? You're right. It is very hard to get any peer-reviewed studies in the journals because there's almost like an iron wall blocking this. And we got some insight into this during the ClimateGate scandal in 2009 when a bunch of emails were hacked and leaked to the public showing a bunch of so-called climate scientists, in fact, some of the leading so-called climate scientists, conspiring to hide their data from other researchers, conspiring to hide the decline in global temperatures, and conspiring to silence any scientists who wouldn't go along with the narrative, keep them out of the journals, keep them out of TV, media interviews, etc. And so what happened is these papers were just really solid. These three journals that published them, they're not known for being climate denier publications, but the science was very sound. They did one special issue in the journal Climate, for example. They had some guest editors, including Dr. Ned Nikolov, who I wrote about back in 2017. They looked at this. They said, wow, this is correct as best as we can tell. So the peers looked at it. They accepted it. And this is a really prestigious team, Josh. We're talking about almost 40 scientists from around the world. The lead author, Dr. Willie Soon, one of the world's top astrophysicists, if not the top astrophysicist. He used to be at the Harvard-Smithsonian. You've got Ronan Connolly. These are very, very well-established, very prestigious, highly credentialed experts. And it's good to finally see some alternative viewpoints published in the peer-reviewed literature. I think the dam is finally cracking, Josh. Yeah, well, you know, what I've heard from a lot of people before was that nobody dares say it. Everybody understands it. Nobody dares say it. What effect are we seeing now that some pretty credible people are stepping forward on this? That's exactly right. And I reached out to a lot of scientists for my article in the Epoch Times about this. And over and over again, I kept saying, you know, I'd love to comment, but I can't because my funding is going to be jeopardized. My grant is going to be jeopardized. You know, if I get associated with saying that these papers are important, I'm going to be labeled and I won't be able to participate anymore in scientific debates. So there's still a very real sense that that's going on. But when you look at the scientists behind these papers, for example, Dr. Willie Soon, these are people who have now moved away from the major institutions. Dr. Willie Soon ended his time at Harvard-Smithsonian last year, and they're now working independently. So they have an organization called CERES. That's the real issue, right? Any scientist who comes out and says, hey, the U.N. is not telling the truth, the federal government is not telling the truth, their grants are going to dry up. If they're not tenured, they're going to be at risk of losing their job. But when you take a bunch of scientists who are completely independent, who don't need federal grants, who don't need to participate with the U.N., they have a lot more freedom, and I think that's what's going on here.

And even though most of these measures are being taken in preparation for the large crowd that the solar eclipse will draw in, this has not stopped people from believing that some of these measures are a bit extreme and coming up with theories that something more is happening on the day than we're being told. Theories range from some people believing that the US will get hit with a solar storm knocking out the power grid or internet, to others believing that the world is about to go through three days of complete darkness and then enter a new age. Now obviously we won't know for sure if anything will happen until the day of the solar eclipse, but I did find something interesting that a lot of people aren't talking about. According to scientists, a solar maximum is also supposed to take place this year, which means that the sun will be at a heightened level of activity and its poles will shift. This heightened level of activity could lead to solar flares or storms that may hit Earth's electromagnetic field and lead to power outages. There was even a solar flare last week that caused the radio blackout, but maybe it's all just a coincidence.

They've never recorded Marsquakes caused by underground activity on Mars before. So what do we mean here? Are we talking earthquakes? No, earthquakes happen on Earth. We're on Mars. Earthquakes are happening here right now, although they shouldn't be. Mars is thought to have died 3.5 billion years ago from an unknown catastrophe. Oh, I see, because when I look around, what you mean is that this place is scorched, it's all burnt up. But except for the strange duck, I mean, really, OK, but anyways, can you explain to us, the viewers, what you mean by Mars has died? Of course. According to numerous studies, Mars was a planet with an ocean, a warm, a humid climate and life. But look around, there's no ocean here anymore, and there is no life. The core of this planet no longer functions, and the planet's interior is inactive. But at the end of 2019, suddenly, NASA detected a Marsquake here, and their frequency began to rapidly increase. As of today, in just such a short period, over 1,300 Marsquakes have been recorded, and their numbers are only growing. The most powerful Marsquakes in the entire observation period, with a magnitude of 5, occurred in May 2022. This indicates that Mars, once considered a dead planet, has actually come back to life. Seismic processes have been activated, suggesting that the planet is alive within. What's this? Is this a Marsquake? Uh-huh. OK? OK, I'm OK. All right. So it turns out that seismic activity is now increasing on Mars, simultaneously with what's happening on Earth? Yes, and exactly for the same reason. According to NASA research, such Marsquakes began to occur because magma started to rise from the Martian depth. And as we know, this happens because external cosmic influence is supplying Mars with additional energy that heats the magma and causing it to set. As far as we know, the same energy from cosmic influence once killed Mars, because when there is an excess of this energy, it can kill a planet. And this catastrophe occurred not 3.5 billion years ago. We're talking 24,000 years ago. So for more details on how this happened, watch the documentary film, Mystery of Mars Death Documentary. Unfortunately, the same catastrophe that happened on Mars now threatens the Earth.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

You're having a dream. Here's the reality. Oil, natural gas, and coal provide 84% of all the world's energy. That's down just two percentage points from 20 years ago. And oil still powers nearly 97% of all global transportation. Contrary to headlines claiming that we're rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels, it's just not happening. Two decades and $5 trillion of governments investing in green energy, and we've barely moved the needle. This was supposed to be easy. Why is it so hard? In a word, rocks. To get the same amount of energy from solar and wind that we now get from fossil fuels, we're going to have to massively increase mining by more than 1,000%. This isn't speculation. This is physics. Copper, iron ore, silicon, nickel, chromium, zinc, cobalt, lithium, graphite, and rare earth metals like neodymium. We need them all. And then those metals and materials have to be turned into motors, turbine blades, solar panels, batteries, and hundreds of other industrial components. That also takes lots of energy, which requires even more mining. As a World Bank study put it, these green technologies are in fact significantly more material intensive than our current energy mix. That may be the understatement of the century. Raw materials account for 50 to 70% of the costs to manufacture both solar panels and batteries. Until now, it hasn't really mattered that much because wind and solar still account for only a few percentage points of the global energy supply. They're an applause line for environmentalists, not a major energy player, and it's unlikely they will be in the foreseeable future. But for the sake of argument, let's say we sharply ramp up mining. Where would these new mines be located? Well, for one, China. That country is today the single largest source of most of our critical energy materials. The United States is not only a minor player, but is dependent on imports for 100% of 17 critical minerals. Do we want to give China more political and economic leverage? Europe has made itself dependent on Russia for 40% of its natural gas. How well has that worked out? Ironically, we have all the minerals we need right here in North America, but good luck trying to get them out of the ground. Proposals to build mines in the United States and increasingly almost everywhere else meet fierce opposition, if not outright bans. To give just one example, in 2022, the Biden administration canceled the proposed copper and nickel mine in northern Minnesota. This was after years of delays navigating a maze of environmental regulations. And yes, the same environmentalists and green-leaning politicians who tout all the benefits of electric cars are the same people who make mining the materials essential to build those cars, like copper and nickel, all but impossible. Try to square that circle. So far, we've only talked about today's energy needs. What about tomorrow's? Future energy demand will be far greater than today's. That's been true for the entire history of civilization. The future will not only have more people, but also more innovations. And entrepreneurs have always been better at inventing new ways to use energy than to produce it. It's obvious, but worth stating, before the invention of automobiles, airplanes, pharmaceuticals, or computers, there was no energy needed to power them. And as more people become more prosperous, they will want the things others already have, from better medical care to vacations to cars. In America, there are about 80 cars for every 100 citizens. In most of the world, it's about 5 per 100 citizens. Over 80% of air travels for personal purposes, so that's 2 billion barrels of oil a year. Hospitals use 250% more energy per square foot than an average commercial building. And the global information infrastructure, the cloud, already uses twice as much electricity as the entire country of Japan, the world's third-largest economy. The massive data centers at the heart of the cloud alone consume almost 10 times more electricity than the world's 10 million electric cars. E-commerce has taken off, and it's propelling record growth in warehouses, increasingly filled with energy-hungry robots. America's truck freight index more than doubled in the past decade to deliver the goods to and from those warehouses. These are today's known trends. While we can't predict the future, we can predict there'll be more innovation in robotics, drones, quantum computing, biotechnology, and new industries not yet imagined. All of it will require more energy, a lot more. Fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and yes, renewables will be required. But if you think we could get it all from wind and solar, dream on.

We were in a period of cooling. But since we've been measuring temperature in the 1850s, we've had three periods of warming and two of cooling and one period of stasis. So it was that period of cooling that got people concerned, are we having a minor cooling or are we going into a massive ice age? The same people, some 15 years later, were telling us, because we started to come out of that cooling cycle, oh, we're going to fry and die and we're going to die from all this heat. Well, we were not told that most deaths from climate are in cold times. This is when we have starvation. This is when we have disease. This is when people die and in warm times, we get an expansion of empires. We get longevity. We get better health. We get better food. So warmer times are good for humans, but we started to come into another slight warming phase and I'm not talking about 10 degrees Celsius change. I'm talking about half a degree change and people then started to say, oh, we're coming into a warming phase, but this is the catch. There was money there. There was a follow the money syndrome that appeared in science and people started to chase money to do research on warming and the best way to get that money was to find someone to blame and the best people to blame are we wealthy Westerners. So it arose out of people not understanding and not having enough data on climate cycles. We've got a lot more information now. People then chasing research funds and there's massive competition for research funds around the world. So if you can get an angle where you frighten people witless, there will be money. So this is not an issue of climate. It's not an issue of the environment. It's an issue of money. The mathematical modelers come up with scary scenarios in a hundred years time, we're going to fry and die, whereas we natural scientists look back in time and say, well, we've seen these cycles before. We've seen them many times and there's nothing to worry about. And I'll give you an example. We came out of the latest glaciation, which was part of the big ice age. We came out of the latest glaciation 14,400 years ago. Since then, the temperature has been warming. So if you want to ask someone, is the planet warming or cooling? You have to say since when? Because since the end of the glaciation, it's been warming. Since the time of Jesus, it's been cooling. Since the time of the Vikings, it's been warming. Since the medieval times, it's been cooling. Since the peak of the ice age, 300 years ago, it's been warming. So this is telling us we've got cycles, but if you just look at a small bracket of time, you can say, oh, we're doomed, we're going to fry and die. So associated with this chasing of money for research is an enormous amount of deceit and some very well-documented fraud to be able to keep the narrative going, to be able to keep eminently unemployable, embittered academics working on their hobby, on their '''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

That's true about life, and it's true about the climate. The climate has been constantly changing since the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago. For example, in just the past 2,000 years, we have seen the Roman warm period, when it was warmer than today. Then came the cooler dark ages, followed by the medieval warm period, when it was at least as warm as today. Then we had the Little Ice Age that drove the Vikings out of Greenland, and most recently, a gradual 300-year warming to the present day. That's a lot of changes, and of course, not one of them was caused by humans. During the past 400,000 years, there have been four major periods of glaciation, meaning that vast sheets of ice covered a good part of the globe, interrupted by brief interglacial periods. We are in one of those periods right now. This is all part of the Pleistocene Ice Age, which began in earnest two and a half million years ago. It's still going on, which means that we are still living in an ice age. That's the reason there's so much ice at the poles. Thirty million years ago, the earth had no ice on it at all. So then what about carbon dioxide, the great villain of the global warming alarmists? Where does that fit into this picture? Not as neatly as you might think. Temperatures and carbon dioxide levels do not show a strong correlation. In fact, over very long time spans, periods of hundreds of millions of years, they are often completely out of sync with one another. Over and over again, within virtually any time frame, we find the climate changing, for reasons we do not fully understand. But we do know there are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Factors such as the shape and size of the earth's elliptical orbit around the sun, activity from the sun, and the amount of wobble or tilt in the earth's axis, among many others. Even the relatively short 300-year period from the peak of the Little Ice Age to the present has not been steady. The latest trend has been a warming one, but it began nearly a century before there were significant carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. And there has been no significant warming trend in the 21st century. Contrary to media headlines, the trend over the past couple of decades has been essentially flat. Meanwhile, human-caused CO2 emissions are higher than ever. About 25% of all the CO2 emissions from human sources have occurred during this period of no net warming. So what are we in for next? Will the temperature resume an upward trend? Will it remain flat for a lengthy period? Or will it begin to drop? No one knows. Not even the biggest, fastest computers. All the information I've presented, the increases, decreases, and plateaus in temperature over the ages and into the last centuries, is available to anyone who wants to seek it out. Yet to state these simple facts is to risk being called a climate change denier. Not only is that absurd, it's mean-spirited. It's absurd because no one, not even the most fervent skeptic, denies that the climate is changing. And it's mean-spirited because to call someone a climate change denier is to intentionally link them to people who deny the Holocaust. So maybe it's time to stop the name-calling. Predicting the climate, one of the most complex systems on earth, with thousands of inputs, many of which we don't understand, isn't an exact science or anything close to it. Maybe it's just a tad arrogant to suggest that we can predict the weather or the climate or just about anything sixty years from now. The science is not settled. The debate is not over. The climate is always changing. It always has been.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Thank you. That's okay. Please sit down. Let him answer. Okay. In 2011, my wife and I were in Antarctica, renewing our vows. For most of you, they don't know Antarctica is on a mountaintop, okay? And there is a $500 million facility, scientific facility there, and the scientists came to give us presentations about global warming. And they had cores of ice that they had drilled. They had drilled 4,000 or 5,000 cores, and they only brought 15 or 20. So they're going through the second or third core, and they said, 275,000 years ago, this was the temperature, and then 55,000 years ago, the world was two degrees warmer Celsius than it is today. This is 2011. And, stop, stop, stop. And he said, and I said, well, do you mean the whole world? And he said, yes. And the poles are only benchmarks. And I said, well, what about the things the young woman alluded to, okay? And he said, it's all cyclical. And although the gas may have exacerbated it, in the cosmos of time, it's not a fart in the wind. In the cosmos of time, of the 13.8 billion years that we've been on this miserable planet, it's not a fart in the wind. And as I told Joe Rogan on his show, and he said in his infinite wisdom, and Joe, if you hear this, I thank you for the opportunity of being on your show. He said, then in 25,000 years, it's most likely not going to be a problem. Now, my direct answer to your question, if that were really true, would you believe, and let's just for a moment say that it is true, that means that the best scenario vis-a-vis global warming is about 10 feet raising water. That's the best scenario over the next 40, 50 years. That's the best scenario. The worst scenario is about 100 feet. But let's just take the 10 feet. If the water on the planet is going to rise up 10 feet, that means the southern part of the United States is gone. England is gone. Most of Europe is gone. And I can go, most of Central America is gone. Anyway, if that's the case, let's just take Florida, for example, which is one of the fastest growing condominium, beachfront condominiums on the planet. In the prospectus, when you invest, there should be, in the footnotes, if global warming is for real, they won't put it that way, global warming happens, and water rises 10 feet, this investment you made is fuck all. Not one single investment prospectus written since 2000, this century, has alluded to global warming. Not one motherfucker. If it were really true, the banks wouldn't invest, the banks wouldn't finance. Not one motherfucking condominium. So the people that have the money, and I'm jealous of the vice president, Gore, which Sally and I rode in a plane from South America with a few years ago, I am jealous he came up with a scam before I did. Because the financial institutions, the banks of this world know it's not going to happen. Otherwise you couldn't get a goddamn loan in London. You know those 30, 40 year mortgages?

I think the question that the young lady asked over here is very valid. Young people are highly intelligent, but I wonder whether they are being told, or which they are entitled to, all the facts in relation to this. When I asked Tania Plibersek, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and the potential Deputy Prime Minister, was carbon dioxide the big issue in relation to climate change, and she said yes. I then said, well that being the case, what percentage of the atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide? This causing climate change, is it carbon dioxide? Yes, carbon dioxide pollution is a major contributor. Okay, so can I ask you, this is not a trick question, what percentage of the earth's air is carbon dioxide? Oh, I don't know. Hang on, you don't know what percentage of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, and yet you're prepared to stand the economy on its head to address a problem, the detail of which you don't know. So when I then explain that the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Alice, is how much? To answer the question, Scott Morrison has said he believes in climate change and that he wants to do something about it. Alice, how much carbon dioxide is the problem? How much carbon dioxide is there in the atmosphere? I'm not a scientist, I don't know. Well, hang on, if you're going to argue the case, you ought to know. It's 0.04 of a percent, and of that 0.04 of a percent, human beings around the world create 3%. And of that 3%, Australia creates 1.3%. But if carbon dioxide is 0.04% of the atmosphere, and human beings are responsible for 3% of that 0.04%, and Australia's responsible for 1.3% of the 3% of the 0.04%, it's like saying there's a granule of sugar on the harbour bridge. Clean the bridge up, it's dirty. Surely if a political party doesn't know the quantum of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, what the hell are we standing the economy on its head for? Demonising coal-fired power, driving everyone into renewable energy which is not available, not reliable and not affordable, plonking us in electric cars, giving us nearly the dearest electricity in the world, when we're rich in energy resources, exporting coal so that China and India and Japan can have cheap electricity, and we sit here, swallowing this ideological rubbish, putting industry at risk, jobs at risk, and burying the economy.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Wild guess. It's okay. I'll buy it. Five percent. Five? I'll just follow you. I'll see their five and suggest that we know that transportation causes 49 percent of CO2, so that's why we're all working on energy transition. All right. So what number do you think it is? Five. Five. How about you? I didn't hear you, Mr. Dreher. Seven. Seven. Do you have one, Mr. Boyd? So we've got a five, seven. The price is right. Eight. I'm going to hit the high end. All right. Well, I appreciate that, and I don't mean to put you on ice. I ask a lot of people that, because all we hear is climate change, climate change, CO2, CO2. I heard a couple of you on the panel saying you're looking to change your vehicles to electric, even though we don't have the electric grid.

Not 1%, not a half of a percent, it's 0.04% and it's gone up from 0.03% over the last couple of decades. This is what we're being all contorted into doing is this tiny change in CO2.

For every hundred people who died in 1920, two died today of a climate-related disaster. You want to know why? More plentiful, abundant access to fossil fuels. Eight times as many people die of cold temperatures as warm ones. Let's think about that fact. Oh, and by the way, in the 1970s, the climate change movement was actually about warning of a looming ice age unless we stopped using fossil fuels. I remember it as a kid. No, no, I do.

So that part didn't make any sense. Now what was interesting is I looked at some of the clouds, and here's a little picture of the cloud, and here's the thermometer of the cloud, and the cloud was at 62 degrees, which I thought was really interesting. So if the sun was heating everything and creating this heat dome and all of that whole entire situation, then the clouds, you would think, would be a lot hotter. It's kind of interesting. Then we go to when we sun gaze. Now this is really interesting. You are turning red. It's a little toasty. It's okay. But anyway, so when we look at the situation with the sun at sun gazing time, we start to see that it's only 380 degrees. So this is getting really, really strange that it's only 380 degrees while sun gazing. Now what's interesting too is, so there was one more on here, and I think I lost it, but what was the weirdest part was when you got the temperature from sun gazing when the sun is just about a little bit over, for example, the mountain or only a little bit left, it's only 90 degrees. So think about that. It's only 90 degrees. The sun is only 90 degrees at, say, 7 01 p.m. How does that make any sense? Now what's interesting is, is we start thinking about how when the sun comes up, and this is what I started testing. I went out at about 5, 6 a.m. when the sun comes up. The sun is about, on this laser reader, the sun is about 90 degrees as it comes up. Then as it comes up a little bit higher, then it gets to 300 degrees. Then as it gets up to 12 noon, it gets over a thousand degrees. And then as it gets past 12 noon, it actually starts to drop again. And then at about 6 p.m., when we start to do our sun gazing, or at sunrise, it's a very low temperature. But what's interesting is, is that's when I'm picking up on my laser.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Can you offer a shred of evidence that within two million people died from converting to clean energy? I can offer clear evidence that the number of climate disaster-related deaths is down by 98% over the last century. The number of people who died of hurricanes, tornadoes, heat waves, and other weather-related events in 1920, for every 100 that died then, two die today. And the reason why is more plentiful, abundant access to fossil fuels and technology powered by fossil fuels. I can also tell you today, it is a hard fact, none of these things are disputed. Eight times as many people die of cold temperatures than die of warm ones. The right answer to all temperature-related deaths is more plentiful, abundant access to fossil fuels.

Okay, because they're wrong So now here's the I didn't let you answer the question mark The reason that they are wrong is because all of these studies are done in the absence of mitigating measures So as I've said before When I talk about climate change when you're talking about climate change There are a couple of things human beings can do and by the way, I accept IPCC estimates They range from sort of be mild like 1.5 degrees Celsius all the way up to be not very mild like 4 degrees Celsius Again over the course of the century and because there is this range the more extreme versions of this the 4 degrees Celsius Whenever you read the IPCC reports, which I have when you read those reports They say in them that they have very low confidence that some of the more catastrophic sort of predictions are going to occur They will say low to moderate confidence the less catastrophic predictions They'll say more like high confidence or or fair fair high confidence that kind of stuff Okay, here is the thing when people suggest that there is not going to be any sort of mitigation measures This is wrong or adaptation. So there's two ways you can deal with it One is mitigation, which is we all stop driving cars. We stop using electricity. We don't have kids anymore, right? We really cut down on our carbon usage in ways that are catastrophic to the world economy And what it really mostly does is it says to people in the developing world? Hey, you're screwed because those are the people who really need carbon based emissions It's very easy for those of us who live in extraordinarily prosperous societies to say, you know I'm cutting down my carbon emissions a little bit because we live in very prosperous societies Carbon-based energy is by far the most efficient form of energy on the planet and it's worthwhile to notice that people who are living in Developing or undeveloped countries those people are still in large part burning things like dung for fuel Which is not only carbon intensive But also a horrifying way to live and telling those people you can't use carbon-based energy is a mistake in order for us to take The mitigation measures that would be necessary in order to dramatically lower the trajectory of global climate change You'd have to get China to sign on which they will not you have to get India to sign on which they will not those are the two largest carbon-based emitters on planet Earth and we live in a geopolitical world in which a carbon emission from China counts the same as a carbon emission from the United States which says Again, this doesn't mean there's nothing we can do It means what we ought to be doing is the thing that will prevent the 83 million deaths Which is why I'm very confident. It'll prevent the 83 million deaths adaptation. So her question to Ben was Why does Ben not believe that climate change is not an emergency? Why does he not believe why yeah, why does he not believe that and He goes into saying that he he uses the IPC's reporting for instance He says that shows that the IPC's reporting has low confidence that Anything catastrophic is going to happen over the next century and he goes on to explain why the IPC's reporting is something that you can trust you should read about and look into He says that you know, of course he believes that we can do things individually on our own but to take extreme measures and Would only be hurting people who live in underdeveloped or developing countries because they rely on Carbon they rely on the things that we want everyone to stop doing or stop using right and they don't even have half of it Anyways, but carbon for instance is an example that he used And he says by the way, he goes unless China or India which I guess are the the biggest two countries that Produce a lot of and use carbon and pollution and stuff Unless they participate and he says there there's just no way they will they haven't thus far. Why would they? It's not it, you know what we do here is not going to control climate change And that's why he says that what we should be focusing on is adaptation'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Check this out. You're welcome honey. So what you're watching is the alleged proof of the 24-hour sun in Antarctica. It's a 24-hour time lapse appearing to show the sun traveling around in a big circle and staying above the horizon for 24 hours. It looks pretty good. The shadows match well, the lighting seems right, the video seems pretty convincing, and the clouds don't repeat 24 hours later like they did in this video where the exact same cloud pattern repeats a day later. It's crazy how much effort goes into faking these videos. Remember the saying, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. But in this case the clouds don't repeat 24 hours later. Instead we're going to be looking at the sun with the same exact sun flares that repeat 24 hours later. I've synced the two segments of the video together. Remember the bottom video is supposed to be 24 hours later. The clouds are different and the lighting slightly changes but the sun flares on the camera are exactly the same. I have freezed a few frames so that you can look closer. I'm convinced these repeating sun flares are impossible as the slightest variation in angles and atmospheric conditions would alter the sun flares. But I could still see someone plausibly claiming that the repetition of the same sun flares over an approximate 12 hour period is purely a coincidence. Okay, I highly doubt it but I can see the very slight possibility. But there is one more thing that repeats which I refer to as the coup de grace that proves that this video is indeed a fake. Here's the clip in question. Did you see it? Here it is again. Did you see the lighting artifact flash on and off at the same exact time? Here it is again at a very slow speed. The flashes are exact and at the same video frames. That's impossible. There is no excuse. This video is another fake. There you go. Another blatant fakery that took some serious effort to fool you into believing in their gold model. How many times will they be able to fool you? Clearly this shows us, if anything, that trickery is afoot. And this is not just one of the months. This is not just two of the months. It's not just five of the months. This is every month that they have a webcam video for. They have edited and cut out part of the day. And these are during the main months, which are January, December, and November, the southern summer. In this video, let's watch this green flag down below. You'll see it starting around maybe seven o'clock, eight o'clock, rotates around to about two o'clock, and then resets. Rotate around. Reset. This is obviously a lie. This is obviously not what's going on. Why don't we get to see the sun do a 360 degree turn around the southern continent? Now remember, this would be pretty good evidence and proof of the globe, because it doesn't work on a flat earth to see the sun go around the southern continent. However, on a globe, it is something that should be really evident and should be seen in every single summer video from the South Pole. But again, watch the flag. It'll start around eight o'clock, rotate around until it gets to two, and then reset and start over. This should be a huge eye opener. Should be something something that screams to you fraud, fake, set up, contrived. So I emailed the head of the Australian Antarctic Division there, and she wrote back and basically said that the webcams at their Antarctic stations are subject to very limited internet connections, and frequent interruptions and dropouts are commonplace as the outages due to weather are extreme. Very slow bandwidth means we are unable to have constant streaming video. The time lapses you see on our site are stitched together from photos generated every 15 minutes, and basically saying that there'd be no way that they could have data from a whole entire day. Just taking a look at Mawson Station's current time lapse, for example, the images are being recorded overnight, and nothing appears to be missing. If you do notice anything absent on any of our webcams, please let us know the specifics so we can investigate any potential faults or even maybe restore images where possible. So I'm like, what the hell are you talking about? Why don't you have complete day's videos? You're cutting them yourself. So I wrote back, and she responded with, Hi Jaron, I've spoken to our web manager who was not available earlier. He let me know that some frames are actually missing by design because the webcams were set up so long ago he had forgotten about a script he had written to omit frames that are mostly all black to save on space, bandwidth, and overall quality of the video. Chunks of time with just black screens are a bit of a waste, he said, that if there is any reasonable light source in the image, then the image would not be omitted, and that the missing frames are based only on the amount of light in the image. That if there is any reasonable light source in the image, then the image would not be omitted, and that the missing frames are based only on the amount of light in the image. Thanks for your email. We will now add this to the FAQ for future webcam visitors. And if you can't tell, this is complete and total horseshit, because what we were just looking at was the summer months when there is no night. Supposed to be 24 hours of sun going around. Why are those images omitted? So I said, Jen, I still think you aren't quite understanding what I'm saying. If you have time-lapse webcam footage from the Amundsen Scott base, then why is there no 24-hour sun video? You guys have cut and edited every single video. Why? It makes no sense with your answers below about black screens. Please explain. For example, watch all videos for November, December, January 2011, 2012, 2013. And the most recent email, which came earlier this week, said, Hi, Jaren, the Amundsen Scott station is an American facility, and for all inquiries regarding their webcam footage, you need to contact them. The information and explanation that Jen provided below still applies to ours. Kind regards, Denise. So I have emailed all the people at the NOAA and the NSF, and we were waiting to see if they've got anything new to say besides just the same nonsense responses.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

This one is absolutely disturbing. In Season 24, Episode 9, Homer Simpson is preparing a bunker fully stocked with provisions for his family, anticipating something dreadful on the horizon. Shortly after, a solar superstorm strikes Springfield, a silent, invisible tempest sweeping through the town, causing severe consequences. This catastrophic event leads to a complete shutdown. No internet, no electricity, everything comes to a standstill. A solar superstorm could wipe out the internet for weeks or even months or even forever. The portrayal of a solar superstorm in the episode aligns with the potential real-world impact such an event could have. Interestingly, NASA has recently made a shocking discovery, a massive hole in the sun called the Coronel Hole. This hole, large enough to engulf 60 Earth-sized planets, is currently releasing solar storms at a staggering speed of 1.8 million miles per hour, and could be headed to Earth fast. The last time the Earth experienced such a storm was in 1859. It was known as the Carrington Event. The 2024 solar storm is predicted to be 60 times more powerful than the 1859 solar storm, possibly the strongest ever recorded in history. Such solar storms can have catastrophic effects on Earth, affecting satellite power grids, GPS, and potentially wiping out hard drives and the entire internet permanently might take decades for us to recover.

Let's go to Sir Maurice Strong, a senior official of the UN. He has long been quite open about his desire to establish a world government, by which he does not mean a democratic government. Maurice Strong. If Al Gore is the front man for global warming, Maurice Strong is the wizard behind the curtain. Maurice Strong. Born in Canada, he's worked for decades with the United Nations, and he's gained a reputation as the world's leading environmentalist. Nations must accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions on others, in my view. Maurice Strong was Secretary General of the UN's 1972 Conference on the Human Environment, the one that launched the Green Movement, first director of the UN's Environment Program, organizer of the UN's Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, the one that set the stage for the Kyoto Treaty on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. We are united as one family, on one home in this universe, and it's called the Earth, and it is the home of all of us, and it can only be saved by the cooperation of all of us. But many say Maurice Strong is a wolf in sheep's clothing, that he pretended to be green so he could get rich and take over the world. Under the polluter pays principle, those who create the damage shouldn't pay for it. And of course, we in the industrialized countries are creating most of it, and therefore we need to pay for most of it. You see, Maurice Strong is also a billionaire, an oil billionaire. He's a director of the Chicago Climate Exchange, which trades and sells carbon credits, the ones that give permission to pollute. And he was linked to the United Nations' oil for food corruption scandal. After that, he quit the UN and moved to Beijing, China. He was one of those who was instrumental in establishing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has now produced four major assessments of the climate, each of them more blood-curdling than the last, each of them more absurd than the last, and they've now got things to such a fever pitch that they will, I think, get an agreement on, is that what will become a world government should be established. Christopher Monckton accuses Maurice Strong of stirring up global warming hysteria and doing it through deception. Falsifying data. Falsifying the data. They have been deliberately bending the data. And I guess that would lead me to Ben Santer, right? That's the UN. That would lead you to Ben Santer. Dr. Benjamin Santer, climate scientist. And according to global warming skeptics, Maurice Strong's accomplice. They say he altered a crucial UN report on climate change, deleting opinions that oppose the global warming theory. In comes Ben Santer and rewrites it for them, after the scientists have sent in their finalized draft. And that finalized draft said, at five different places, there is no discernible human effect on global temperature. You've seen a copy of it? I've seen a copy of this. Santer went through, crossed out all of those, and substituted a new conclusion, and this has been the official conclusion ever since. Now, who is Maurice Strong? A lot of people know him as the godfather of the environmental movement. And my daughter mentioned Maurice Strong the whole time as well. Maurice Strong made the statement that the problem for the planet are the industrialized nations, and isn't it our responsibility to get rid of them? This guy's been tied to the UN for over 30 years, having different titles within the UN. But he's also making money off of it. He's made millions.

I had a friend point out the chemtrails one day, years ago, and I didn't know what he was talking about. I said, isn't that just what planes do? I laughed the first time I heard that. I said, there's absolutely no way. Does a secret government program exist that requires airplanes to spray chemicals in our skies? Is there evidence to support this claim? And if so, why is it happening? Is it to combat climate change, or could it be something more sinister? So I became interested in what was going on, started researching the issue, which many people refer to as chemtrails. I came to the realization that something probably was happening in the sky. Geoengineering destroys rain clouds, it destroys blue sky, it creates just a murky white flat sky. The longer I've been aware of them and watching them, the program is elegant, it is exquisite. Chemtrails stands for chemical trails that many believe are being poured into our atmosphere by planes. This, however, has been dismissed by mainstream news, science, and government agencies who offer that these are naturally occurring streaks of condensed water vapor known as contrails. Award-winning weatherman Scott Stevens began to notice strange weather patterns during the late 90s. What I learned is I'm not forecasting the natural processes of this planet anymore. I have to anticipate, not forecast, but anticipate an agenda. I truly thought as I began to talk and to share my observations that there would have been a fairly healthy movement to investigate these things. I knew that I would lose my job. I just didn't know how quickly it would happen. We used to see, you know, occasional contrails, little short trails that would dissipate of jet exhaust. But now we see these lingering chemtrails and you'll see grid spraying and the planes go back and forth, back and forth, and you'll see trails go horizon to horizon. This isn't water vapor. This is material being put in the atmosphere. And I could compare this with a skywriter. When you see someone doing skywriting, that's not water vapor. It's material that sticks. For those who do not believe, if you look at time lapse and there's plenty on the internet, you can see what aerosols look like in our atmosphere. These chemtrails are absolutely required to impact whatever weather event they were designing. And the trails were an absolute necessary ingredient for them to achieve their weather modification goals. If chemtrails play a role in modifying the weather, what could the possible reason be? During the Vietnam War, Operation Popeye was a top-secret campaign that successfully weaponized the weather, causing extreme flooding in supply lines. In 1996, a detailed research paper was delivered to the Air Force outlining steps to own the weather by 2025 for military purposes. A 2008 workshop at the Council on Foreign Relations discussed reversing global warming by geoengineering. They also pointed out the significant risks it could impose worldwide. During the 2008 Olympics, China boasted that they would have perfect weather for their opening ceremony by weather manipulation. So if the Chinese can do this, and if there's technology to do it, why would we believe that weather events here are natural? It's no longer experimental. Weather modification is a full-blown operation. The military-industrial complex knew that they needed to have the weather on their side for their next war. And that was the goal. To control the weather is to control the population. And weather as a weapon has always been sought after by militaries going back many, many decades, even prior to World War II. So there's no debate, there's no dispute, this is not a theory, it's not conjecture. These programs are going on, plain and simple. And anybody who truly does any investigation will get to the bottom of this. And it's the biggest elephant in plain sight in human history. What they're doing is selling these programs to the public as a way to mitigate global warming. And the theory is putting these chemicals into our sky will actually reflect sun back into space and thus cool the planet. The problem with this is, at night, the aerosols actually act as a blanket and they trap heat. In the past 10 to 15 years, we've seen a great increase in nighttime highs. So the question really remains, what is the objective of these programs and why would they implement something that's so damaging to the planet? There have been over 160 U.S. patents filed starting in 1891 that pertain to weather modification. Is it possible that some of these are secretly being used? And if so, what are they spraying and could it have an impact on our health? Again, what we see in the sky matches what geoengineers deny they're doing but state that they want to do. And what we're finding around the world matches not only what geoengineers are proposing but a number of geoengineering patents designed to specifically spray these toxins into the planet, which are aluminum, barium, and strontium. Things that are connected with heavy metals are skyrocketing. You know, record amounts of asthma, autism, and Alzheimer's is being found in younger and younger patients, even in their 50s. So something is going very, very wrong. Without question, it is in the air that we breathe, so we're inhaling this. Is this a failed project in an attempt to save the planet from global warming or an operation to manipulate the weather for profit or war or something else? And what can we do about it? Everybody can play a profound part to help this issue come to light. We have flyers on the front of geoengineeringwatch.org that people can download and print. And when the people who are aware of this collectively stand up and say no, these programs will come to a halt. We have to first clean the air, but we have to clean ourselves. We need to heal ourselves from this. So there are different vitamins I take that will block heavy metals in the body, and there are supplements, herbs that I use to chelate heavy metals out of the body. So I'm not as debilitated anymore by this. We will be able to restore a fragile planet that's been molested in so many ways.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

And the further back in time, the greater this error becomes, and it can be thousands of years. However, cyclic cataclysms occur exactly every 12,000 years. Facts and dates are very stubborn things. So unfortunately, we are forced to state that we are just in for the next such cycle. A 12,000 year cycle of climatic catastrophes, which is overlapped by a more catastrophic 24,000 year cycle. So unfortunately, the worst case scenario awaits us.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

What? Lack of oxygen? Well, it's interesting. The huge dinosaurs, an 80-foot apatosaurus, for example, had nostrils the same size as a horse. How is an 80-foot animal going to get enough air through nostrils the size of a horse's? Sometimes in the amber, which is tree sap, hardened, petrified, sometimes they find air bubbles. The air bubbles, when they suck them out and analyze them, are 50% more oxygen than we have today. The air we're breathing now is 21% oxygen. What if it was 35%? If the atmosphere originally was 35% oxygen and double the air pressure, just breathing would be exciting. Baby Jessica was 18 months old, and her left leg slipped down in a pipe. Her right leg came up behind her, and she did the splits. She slid down 20 feet inside an 8-inch pipe. She was down there for two and a half days. They tore up the neighborhood trying to get that kid out of there, out of that pipe. When they finally got her out, her right leg was completely black from lack of circulation. One of the doctors said, we have to cut her leg off right now. It's black, no circulation. Another doctor said, hey, before we start cutting stuff off, let's try putting her in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. In a what? Hyperbaric, high-pressure oxygen chamber. They put Jessica in one of these things and pumped it up to double normal pressure with pure oxygen. Within a few hours, her leg turned pink. They restored circulation. They finally had to cut off half of her little toe. She would have lost her whole leg had it not been for hyperbaric therapy. Dr. Kimori in Japan started raising tomato plants with filtered sunlight. He used a mirror system to collect sunlight and send it through fiber optic cable to his plants. So the plants would not be getting ultraviolet light or x-rays, only sunlight, pure light. His tomato plant grew 16 feet tall and produced 900 tomatoes. This is one, one plant. They moved it to a shopping center, built scaffolding to hold up the branches. They said this thing might produce 10,000 tomatoes. It ended up growing over 40 feet tall and produced 15,000 tomatoes off one plant. They were cherry tomatoes, but his were coming off baseball size. I think maybe the whole earth was that way. I think it had not only a canopy to filter out the radiation, it had increased air pressure, richer CO2, pure gene code, better soil. And the birds chirping is what opens up the leaf cells so they can breathe in the morning. One guy got curious, why did the birds start chirping an hour before sunrise? Well, they've discovered that frequency of the chirp, chirp, chirp opens up the stomata under the leaf.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

This photo in and of itself is some pretty awesome proof. I've explained this before, but for all the people that didn't see that video, because I'm so shadowbanned, if you go from the west coast to the east coast, flying with the spin of the Earth supposedly, because the Earth is supposedly spinning 1,000 miles per hour eastward, the flight should be longer, right? Going with the spin of the Earth. And then vice versa, if you're going east to west, you're going against the spin of the Earth, it should be shorter. The time? Only 40 minutes. That and the fact that planes use a model called FEM, Flat Earth Model, it should tell you that the Earth might be flat and stationary. And if you want more proof that we are stationary and the atmosphere, ether, medium, whatever is encompassing us is the only thing that's moving. You just have to look at how wind works. So, warm air rises and it cools. So it creates movement. So that's basically how wind works. Again, the molecules from the heat of the sun rises the pressure of the air and then they equalize and move around and switch around. That creates wind, essentially. So you'd have to agree that the molecules of the air rising, equalizing, moving, the wind, creating the wind is part of the atmosphere, right? And one of the first questions I asked when I first found flat Earth is, the Earth is spinning a thousand miles per hour eastward. Why don't we spin under the clouds? And the heliosexuals fired back with that the gravity of the Earth is holding all of the atmosphere and the clouds and all of the molecules in the atmosphere, clouds, medium, ether, whatever you want to call it, with the perfect spin of the Earth. Gravity is pulling it perfectly with it. So you got to realize it. You really want to drive this one home. The Earth is supposedly holding all of this atmosphere, this air, perfectly. While at the same time, satellites can geocentrically, geostationarily, and polarily orbit, supposedly. And the gravity supposedly doesn't keep pulling it in. It just leaves it out there. It doesn't pull it any closer to the... We're not talking about that, though. All that I'm trying to get at here is that if the Earth's gravitational pull is holding all of the atmosphere, all of the molecules, everything in all of these, these layers of the atmosphere, what happened to these molecules? Why aren't these molecules being held with the thousand-mile-per-hour spin of the Earth? You already know what I think. The Earth's flat, and the atmosphere's moving. Not us.

Now check out the compass. Where's it pointing to when we're going this way? West, right? All the way around, it's pointing west. And you can look it up yourself. We can only circumnavigate the earth from east to west. Nobody ever in history has ever circumnavigated the earth north to south. Which means if you start here in the North Pole, you cannot circumnavigate around back to the North Pole by going flying over the south. Because there is no south. They don't want you to know that. So that's why it's called no fly zones and you're not allowed to circumnavigate over what they call Antarctica. Which is not really Antarctica, it's an ice wall and it ends there. And that's why they ban you from flying over it. Because you'll know once you get there you can't fly over it. I mean it's really really common sense. Now pay attention as we turn the flat earth map into a globe. Pay attention to the continents. They are still positioned north, east, west, and south. And take a look at the ice wall. What's it become when you turn it into a bowl? It becomes the Antarctica. And if you notice it's south of all the continents just like the ice wall is south of all the continents on the flat earth map. And therefore you cannot tell the difference. The only reason that you believe what you believe is because that's what you have been taught to believe without questioning it. Now this is not something new. You know this is, everyone has known this for 5,000 years. All ancient civilizations. All the way up, I mean this map is 1892. It says scientifically and practically correct. This is not something new. This has always been like this. And in the last 100 years with these fake government agencies, especially NASA in the last 50 years has convinced you otherwise. Now look, even the ice wall itself is named all the way around it. Now all of a sudden that we live on a globe, all those places are gone. They don't exist anymore. Well how did they exist in 1892? But they don't exist now. And as you can see right here on the map it says Antarctic Circle. It doesn't say Antarctic Continent because it's a circle of ice that surrounds the earth and holds all of the oceans in. So anyways that is how you circumnavigate on a flat earth.

I can hear farmers all over the small country of ours shocked and perhaps screaming at their televisions because they're saying, are you saying all animal farming, in your opinion, really needs to stop? Yes, it does. It really does. It's a bit like leaving fossil fuels in the ground. Unless we do that, we've really got very little chance, indeed, of preventing this domino effect of system collapse right across Earth's systems, which basically makes the planet uninhabitable. So eating meat and milk and eggs is an indulgence we cannot afford. That's George Monbiot of The Guardian. Eating milk and eggs is an indulgence we cannot afford. It's pretty weird to see The Guardian, which still wants the English to do penance for the last Irish famine, now getting their columnists to enforce the next Irish famine by having hoity-toity English media blokes telling Irish farmers it's time for them to retrain as diversity consultants or transgender swimmers or get on the boat to Hollyhead and try to join the Lincolnshire Police Macarena dancers. We have farmed for 12,000 years, but those days are done. Ava Vlaardingerbroek is here. Ava, your farmers in the Netherlands started this increasingly worldwide protest. What's at the back of it? What's the big picture here? Well, it's almost like there is a global plan to cut all the cattle farms and to have us all eat crickets. Am I right? It sounds like not just the Netherlands, but many Western countries are facing these plans. And the Netherlands was a country that was particularly hit hard with this. Our farmers are fighting against the new 2030 agenda that is being forced upon them. Our government is taking their lands away, and they're doing this all under the so-called nitrogen crisis, which is a completely made-up crisis, which we've also seen from our governments before. And well, they're not having it. And they've been protesting for a long time. But our government also doesn't seem to budge and still says that those 2030 new environmental rules are sacred. That's what they said. So we're kind of curious to see now how this is going to play out and what our farmers are going to do and how they're going to continue fighting the government, because like I said, the government is not budging. No, you've been coming up with some extraordinary facts here. The Dutch government claims it can't afford to lower income tax because it would cost 4 billion for every 1%. I'm not sure what that is, 4 billion euros, I assume. But they're spending 25 billion on this so-called nitrogen crisis, and they're spending 17 billion on immigration. So the costs of actually making things a little better for ordinary citizens is insignificant compared to all these policies of choice to remake our society in a way it hasn't been remade for 12,000 years. Exactly. So it's very clear what they're doing here. We have to stop pretending that this is a sort of natural disaster, that we're facing all these crises that nobody can do anything about, or we have to stop claiming foreign wars happening for all of the poverty that we're facing, because the fact of the matter is that the Dutch are going to have a very dark and very cold winter, as it seems. I'm reading about families of four and five that are now facing energy bills of almost 900 or more euros a month. That's not something that anyone can afford. At the same time, our government is saying, we can't do anything for you guys. But what they can do is spend 25 billion euros on a nonsense nitrogen crisis that they're using to expropriate our farmers, which will cause more food shortages, which will cause the price of food to increase, which is already up by 20 percent as well. So none of this makes sense if you think that the government has the best interests of the people at heart. But the fact of the matter is, is that they don't. And their policies show it. The only thing that we need to do is wake up to that fact. Well, in the Netherlands, as in the United States, as in the United Kingdom, as all over the Western world, they seem to have figured out that they can blame it on Putin by turning him into a pantomime villain. But in fact, if it's a choice between what he's doing in the Kremlin and these insane domestic policies at home, it's the insane domestic policies that are leading to Dutchmen having 900 euro monthly energy bills, isn't it? It's what our governments choose. Of course, it's a wonderful thing to always put the blame with someone else and to have people believe, like I said, that this is all the consequences of some sort of natural disaster or crisis. But especially in the Netherlands, we actually have one of the largest gas bubbles under our northern soil in the EU. But the reason they're not using that is because they say it's obviously, again, bad for the climate. It's fossil fuel. And also, it might cause some cracks in houses in the north of the country, and they don't have the funds to properly compensate these people. But like I said, again, there's actually 60 million reserved for the climate transition. There's 25 billion reserved for the nitrogen crisis. There is 17 billion euro reserved per year for importing people from safe countries that do get all of these privileges. This is not something that they're doing as a mistake. It's all by choice. It's intent. I think you're right. It's the obvious explanation. Why would they be doing this if they didn't want to do it? Thank you very much, Ava. You're quite right. And those sums, just for the Netherlands, by the way, there aren't enough printing machines on earth to print the amount of money they're going to need for this.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

While the image of vibrant flowers in the icy landscapes might look like something out of a Disney movie, this is in fact a really bad thing. Plants in Antarctica are growing more quickly due to the climate change and greenhouse emissions, and this could represent a serious problem for the region's ecosystem. Considering Antarctica is one of the harshest environments on Earth, with its extreme cold, strong winds, and limited access to resources, it is very important that it remains that way as any disruption to its environment could cause apocalyptic events all over the world. Aside from polar bears, penguins, and seals potentially going extinct, flowers growing in Antarctica are a sign that the climate is warming, thus leading to sea levels rising that would cause the ocean to cover most coastal cities including New York and Los Angeles. And as a result, the US would become a portion of the size that it is now, and there would be less land for the population to live on. Not to mention Earth just had one of the hottest summers in history of humanity, so it looks like the plant growth in Antarctica is not slowing down anytime soon.

I've done some calculations and some percentages and I'm going to need someone who's really good at maths to help me out with this. I've done the basic ones. So our planet has existed, or as we scientists believe it's existed, for 4.5 billion years. Give or take 50 years is what they say. And it's believed that human beings have existed on earth for 315,000 years. Yeah? You with me? 315,000 into 4.5 billion means we have existed on the earth in its lifespan for 0.007% of its life cycle. And out of that 315,000 years that humans have existed, our industrial age, one where we're really polluting the planet, is said to be about 120 years. Around about the 1900s is probably when we really started getting into industry. Let's give it, give or take 20 years. Let's actually give it another, let's say 150 years. So 150 years out of 315,000 years. Do you know what the percentage of that is? It's 0.038%. So our industrial age has lasted 0.038% of our entire human existence. If you then put that 120 to 150 years of our industrial revolution into the lifespan of the planet, it is 2.6666667E-10%, which I believe is 0.00000026% of existence on the planet. So our industrial age has been 0.00000026% of the lifespan of the planet. And we're led to believe that we're affecting the climate, five ice ages, tectonic plates moving all over the place, planet's been up and down in temperature by 20 or 30 degrees over its existence, and in 120 years we're causing the planet to go into a meltdown? Come on. Now I don't want to upset anyone because obviously we're polluting the oceans and it's terrible. We need to stop, I've banged on about this before, we need to stop using the plastics and we do need to stop tyres, stuff like that. We need to come up with alternatives. We are killing our oceans, that's undeniable, and our rubbish and our waste is definitely causing a problem. But when we talk about the planet heating up and cooling down, when we talk about earthquakes and changes in temperature and weather, 0.038% just in human existence of our industrial age, and then in the lifespan of the planet, it's an unquantifiable equation because it's so small and minute. In fact it's equated to if you took 10,000 football fields and put a big square in, put a pin in the corner, that's our existence.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

There are many reasons. And if you're in government, you should take the time to watch this video. It will be an eye-opener for many of you. If you increase taxes on cigarettes, you'll create less smokers. And it's because people know that smoking's bad for your health. And if it costs more, and then it's also bad for your health, ultimately you'll decide to quit. It's because you do not need to smoke to survive. When it comes to carbon, you need it to survive. Until there's a viable replacement for carbon emissions, you will be burning it to live. So even if you tax the hell out of it, you still need to get to work, and you still need to heat your home. You have zero choice. So this concept of putting a price on pollution does not work. There is no alternative right now. Canada has something called the borer forest, which represents 1.2 billion acres in land right here. We also have the second largest landmass on planet Earth. If we actually wanted to create a plan that is viable, and it saves Canadians' livelihood as well as the planet, we would be focusing on carbon capturing as opposed to a tax scheme which is impoverishing everybody and creating poverty. Oh yeah, and let's not forget about inflation because carbon tax creates inflation. Other countries only wish they had as much landmass as us, as well as the ability to create forests like this, which is a carbon capture. We can actually enrich our population as well as save the planet at the exact same time. Let me explain. If we planted billions of additional trees across the country, and we created a plan to capture the carbon through our forests, we would be creating a plan that is actually viable. We already have something called forest management. It's where you cut the tree down before the tree has the ability to re-emit the carbon back into the environment. Here's a diagram that shows how this all works with the forest management program. We're currently not putting enough resources for scientists to accurately calculate how much carbon our forests are actually absorbing. See, if we planted billions of trees and we invested in scientists to accurately calculate how much carbon we're actually absorbing with our forests, we would be able to calculate our carbon sink and sell those credits to higher polluting countries across the planet. With just conservative estimates, we could be making tens of billions of dollars every single year in carbon credits. What would we do with this abundance of funds? And this plan is pretty easy. We plant billions of trees and we let nature do its work. Can you believe it? And the money that we make by selling our carbon credits could be used to advance green technology and carbon capturing initiatives. But no, let's tax the living hell out of every single Canadian at a time where people are struggling to put food on the table. With over 2 million people regularly visiting food banks across Canada, we are scheduling to increase the carbon tax by 23% on April 1st. It's time for change, Canada. Our government is so out of touch and they are out of time. We cannot afford to continue down this path. I'd love to hear from you in the comment section. This is just a recommendation. There are plenty of different ideas that would probably work and it would not impoverish Canadian citizens at the same time. Thanks for watching.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Well, if you're concerned with global warming, as so many people are these days, the answer is obvious. The two words are carbon dioxide, or as it is known by its chemical symbol, CO2, one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen. If we pump much more of it into the atmosphere, the argument goes, we're going to alter the climate, catastrophically. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, which constitute 85% of our energy use, must be reduced to zero by 2100. If we don't save ourselves from ourselves, we're toast. That's the claim. Here's what's strange though. All life is carbon-based, and the carbon for all that life originates from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. All of the carbon in the fossil fuels we are burning for energy today was once in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide before it was consumed by plankton in the sea and plants on the land. Coal, oil, and natural gas are the remains of those plankton and plants that have been transformed by heat and pressure deep in the Earth's crust. In other words, fossil fuels are 100% organic and were produced with solar energy. Sounds positively green. If there were no carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth would be a dead planet, period. Talk about catastrophic climate change. Take away CO2 and you'd have it. And yet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has deemed this essential ingredient for life a pollutant. But how can something that makes life possible be bad? Before I deal with that question, let's get clear on our terms. It has become common to refer to the emissions from burning fossil fuels for energy as carbon emissions. That is entirely misleading. Carbon dioxide is not carbon. Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas which is an indispensable food for all living things. Can you have too much of it? In theory, yes. That's what climate alarmists say is happening now. CO2 levels are getting too high. Are they right? Well, if we look at the big picture, we find something surprising. For most of the history of life on Earth, carbon dioxide has been present in the atmosphere at much higher levels than it is today. During the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life first came on the scene, CO2 levels were as much as 10 times higher than they are today. From a big picture perspective, we're actually living in a low carbon dioxide era. The optimum level of CO2 for plant growth, for example, is 4 to 5 times what is currently found in our atmosphere. That's why greenhouse growers worldwide actually inject additional CO2 into their greenhouses. They want to promote plant growth. Likewise, higher CO2 levels in the global atmosphere will boost food and forest productivity. That will come in handy, since by mid-century we will have to feed 8 to 10 billion people. In fact, we're already seeing the positive effects of increased carbon dioxide now. Satellite measurements have noted the greening of the Earth as crops and forests grow due to our higher levels of CO2. It turns out that carbon dioxide are not dirty words after all. We should celebrate CO2 as the giver of life that it is. I'm Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace for Prager University.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Today we'll be hitting just two things. The solar flare from yesterday and possible CME impact coming from it, and the paper shared during last night's live stream, which I hadn't seen yet, the Air Force is aware of and terrified about the coming pulse shift. We're starting with the last 24 hours on our star, and we find that the day began pretty much right after the morning show, with an impulsive solar flare from the Sunspot group that's beginning to depart. A few other minor pops occurred, and we've got several plasma filaments to keep an eye on. And although impulsive, the flare did appear to have a significant working of the local corona, and a faint CME signature can even be seen on SOHO as well. The initial NASA endless spiral for the event shows a potential glancing blow from the weak CME towards the middle to latter part of the week. It'll be relevant, but not scary. Wish I could say the same thing for our top science today. During the live show last night, someone asked me if I knew about this paper. I did not. It is only posted in the military archive from a captain at the Air Force who is also studying geomagnetism and Earth risk. It's all about our key long-term topic here at the channel, the ongoing geomagnetic excursion, the magnetic pole flip. It caught my interest right off the bat. While we know the magnetic field has declined probably 25-30% since 1859, this paper is suggesting we've lost about 40% over the last 400 years. The field shift has accelerated to 10 times that which we previously thought, and it has major implications for the Earth, including the biosphere. They hit the grids, major issues in agriculture, and to human health. They then end up concluding that we are absolutely not prepared for this event, which is something I definitely agree with and have heard from pretty much every serious scientist in the field over the last decade, especially since most of the focus and funding is currently going to a different kind of environmental change on Earth right now. Folks, this requires a deep dive, and I'll be bringing that to you later today. Come back around 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific for a more significant breakdown of this work in tonight's special video. We greatly appreciate your support. We'll do this all again tomorrow. Right here, but right now, it's 5.30 a.m. in the New Valley of the Sun. Eyes open. No fear. Be safe, everyone.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

It's getting, it's getting hot in there, but I'm doing it in a really soft, fun way. And I'm not lying or anything. I'm not being soft, like deceitful because I'm really not technically a flat earther because I don't know what the fucking earth is. Like it could be a giant globe, you know, just have to be huge. I posted this and of course everyone fucking spiral. Oh, how dare you? That's way different. The one below is at 5,000 feet, you fucking idiot. They don't even know that GoPros have fisheye lenses, by the way. I said, baby boomers are more enraged by this one meme than if their children abort their grandchildren. The only things in the world that matter to them are NASA, money, and going on cruises. Before becoming enraged by photography, really attempt to just not do it this time. I dare you. See, this is how I'm doing it this time. And then someone says, let's say they release the balloons close to the South Pole, everywhere on earth. Will we see the edge of the earth? And let's say they turn the camera, will we see land? I said, there's no way to know because no one in the world is allowed to go to Antarctica outside of three square miles, Antarctica Treaty. And flights aren't allowed to fly over it. For the record, I have no idea what the shape or size of the earth is. I just have a pretty good idea of what it is not. And I said, I've been asking why since I was a kid, looking into why planes are not allowed to fly over Antarctica. The answers are hilarious. It's just too desolate, nowhere to land for emergencies, unlike the Pacific. They'll disturb the penguins. That's an actual excuse. And by the way, people under it are saying this shit. They're like, don't you know, it's so fucking icy. At 35,000 feet, it's all the same conditions. Guys, people fly over the North Pole all the time. All the people literally were like, I'm embarrassed for you, you piece of shit. And then I wrote, it appears to be a superpower in 2023, but I have this magical ability of knowing when people are obviously lying. So if you look up, do flights go over the North Pole? So just look that up. It's very simple. It says, and while it's flown many times every day by a variety of airlines, it's still one of the most awe-inspiring feats in commercial aviation. And look at that map. Look at what that looks like. It's in the middle of fucking nowhere, and it's super cold, right? And then you look up, do commercial airlines fly over Antarctica? They said, there's no reason to fly over Antarctica because it's not in the way to any airport and because it's not an independent country. So you don't fly over Antarctica because it's not an independent country. Dude, people just go, yeah, and you're crazy if you don't think that. In fact, the only reason aircraft currently fly over Antarctica is for research purposes, military reasons, and rescue operations. And then people were posting like, oh, how dare you? At 120,000 feet, this is what the earth looks like. And I just wrote, I'm about to blow a ton of people's minds. The GoPro is a fisheye lens. And then people don't even realize that you absolutely can't fly over Antarctica. You can't go there and explore it. You can't get clearance to land. You can't do any of that shit. Because you go on the internet and they like talk about how it's a conspiracy theory. The Antarctic Treaty Conspiracy Theory. Oh, this is all just flat earthers, don't you know? Claiming land, you can't have nuclear related operation. Man, people are really getting their minds fucked. And there's just flatearth.ws. Who runs that site? No one knows, but it makes me feel really good about myself. So I wrote, think about how many people who are alone on prescription meds so they can emotionally cope with reality. Who are also addicted to pornography. That they just told me they're embarrassed for me because I enjoy trying to calculate the size and shape of the earth. Priorities people, get it fixed. So all of these countries, the one thing they agree on is that no one's allowed to go to or fly over Antarctica. And if you research how you can fly to Antarctica, you need special training, permission from all the countries. And you're only allowed to go to one very small area. That's a fact. Once you start pulling on this thread, now I don't know what the earth is, but I won't be ashamed because I want to know where I am. I'm just way too strong at this point for these people. No, you're an embarrassment. I like some of your takes and you're really funny, but you're a fucking, you went crazy. Ban. No, but I like your content. Then don't fucking call me crazy. It's really simple. Learn some etiquette. You disagree with me on the shape of the earth. Why is that such a big deal? Because they're fucking programmed. Because NASA is the religion. The Trinity were the three astronauts that went to the moon and played golf, and they destroyed the tech and they can't go back. And so the Bible has nothing about a spinning ball or the planets or the Big Bang or anything. They created a new religion and no one fucking realizes it's a religion. It's fascinating. And they will fight tooth and nail to keep that religion going. And I'm not upset about it. I'm just like, having 10 people within 10 miles that you trust is way more important than any of this shit. But the thing that is important about this is I get to ask, where am I? And I don't have to trust liars. I did a tweet that is getting spread around quite a bit. And this is just how I feel. People can get mad all they want. It's not gonna do anything. I said, yes, I'm a vaccine skeptic, a climate change skeptic, moon landing skeptic, globe skeptic, fluoride skeptic, pharmaceutical skeptic, processed food skeptic, public schools skeptic. See a pattern? I don't trust liars. And people can be like, how dare you? No, no, I don't have to give my trust. My trust is a gift. And if someone shows me that they're a liar, I don't have to believe a word out of their mouth.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

We already know that the enormous heating of magma expands the volume and exerts more pressure on the thin crust of the planet. This leads to the expansion of the planet and fractures in the earth's crust, beginning first at its thinnest parts, which is along the boundaries of lithospheric plates and the ocean floor. In this example, we see the theory turning into reality because the number of earthquakes in the ocean floor has increased significantly since 1995. You can see this now on the graph. So the earth starts expanding from within like a balloon. That's the best way I see and I'm trying to explain that also to the viewers. So because of this, it literally begins to crack at the seams. These seams are usually in the ocean, though, and it's on the seams that the earthquakes increase. Yep, that is correct. And Professor Arthur Pedrito of Maryland Institute was the first to identify the increase in the number of earthquakes on the ocean floor since 1995. Let us now listen to his commentary. What intrigued me most was the fact that the number of earthquakes was starting to increase rapidly on the ocean's floors. And I said, gee, this looks kind of interesting because it sort of coincides with a large jump in temperature that we saw in 1995. And at that point, I started to research what I call the mid-ocean seismic activity. And sure enough, it's correlated very, very well with global temperatures. Thank you, Professor Vitorito. Note that the number of earthquakes and their magnitude have started to increase on continent as well. Take a look at this graph. You can see an exponential growth in the number of earthquakes according to Volcano Discovery's seismic database. What you can see on this graph is not just a growth. It's an exponential growth. This means that the number of earthquakes is increasing with a huge acceleration. It's important to note that the earthquake has started occurring even in areas where they shouldn't happen. Consider the earthquake in Morocco this year. According to experts, it was abnormal. And no one expected it there. This means that very soon, earthquake may start to occur where you are, even if you have never had them before.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

That's not a lot. You look at, okay, well what about California? They're about 18%. There's a little more incentives in that case. The state's trying to go all EV and of course New York and 17 other states are following in this very foolish move. The reason for that is people need to really take a bigger picture and look. Now you can do your own homework. You can back up my facts and you'll find it to be true. You'll be maybe disappointed or disillusioned because the truth of it is that when you're looking at a vehicle and saying it's better for the earth, it's not. If you look at a combustion engine car or an ICE, we call ICE, internal combustion engine, from cradle to grave, that means all parts to make what it is to what happens at the end when it's done and how recyclable it is, it is more green than an electric powered vehicle. So you think, okay, what about EVs? Well, let's start from the beginning. There are seven rare earth minerals. There's cobalt, which causes cobalt lung. So we don't mine it here, most countries don't because it kills people. But don't worry, they're mining it in South Africa. And who owns the mine? China. Okay, then you got lithium, same problem. The mines are owned by China. It's also hazardous. We could mine lithium here in the US, but the EPA will never let that happen. And one of the largest lithium deposits is in Nevada. But it's also on Native American land. So that's a problem. Then you're saying, okay, what else? So we got cadmium, poisonous, hazardous, mercury, make it go crazy, but also it's dangerous. You have neodymium. That's a really weird product that people don't talk about. It's a magnetic ore, and it's in every single battery. And that's the magnetic property. So first off, that is the rarest of them. There's not a lot of it. And the veins that are there under the ground are all owned by China. So okay, so we're not holding to the Middle East for oil. We're not being self-sufficient here in the US. Instead, we're going to be beholden to China. Okay. So as long as you know that up front. So now you've got these other rare earth minerals. So what happens? They take all these minerals and they melt them together and they put them together like a birthday cake. So there it is done. It's baked. They actually are baked. And some are made in the US and some are made in other countries. But all the minerals come from other countries because we can't mine them here. We don't do it in North America. It's too hazardous and we're not going to put people's lives and the environment at risk. But we'll do that in other countries. It's like, but the environment affects everybody. It's not just like if one country is doing something wrong, it affects all the other countries but no one talks about this. And I have a feeling in 10 years down the road, they're all going to be like, you are right. So here's the thing. If you say this is not recyclable because the batteries are not recyclable, I know there's a company called Redwood Materials who is working on it. But there's a couple of things that you need to know. It's not completely recyclable because if I asked you to take the eggs out of a birthday cake, going back to that cake, you'd go, I can't. It's everywhere. Exactly. So those materials are all blended together and they have to work in a certain way in order for each cell to be the battery for what you use, whether it be a Tesla or a Lightning or fill in the blank. This does not, by the way, this story does not make the manufacturers happy with me. And many a times they will give me the electric car so I get them from dealers because I'm not going to play around. Because I will review them all. I have no dislike for them. They're a very cool product, but you just need to know the facts. So the facts are these are not recyclable and they can't put them in the ground. They can't send them to the moon. They're not going to send them out in the ocean. They're not going to do anything. They're going to sit in a salvage yard and we're going to have an environmental disaster down the road, probably about 2030 because that's when all these batteries that are pulled out of cars where they no longer have life, there's going to be no use for them. Now, if you want to be the first billion or trillionaire, you'll probably be the person that can figure out how to separate this. But right now there's no way to do that. And the hazardous properties that are within those metals are still there. So they don't just disappear when you bake them together as a cake. So now you've got this battery, there are all these cells. They're all, some are cooled by coolant, ethylene glycol. Others are cooled by other liquids. Most of them are cooled by something that's flammable, ethylene glycol, antifreeze, which is why you see that chemical chain reaction from the salt water, from the hurricanes, or cars that are flooded. When one catches fire in one cell, it heats up the next one and it just causes a chemical chain reaction and keeps setting them off. So that's why it takes sometimes weeks and weeks for it finally to be done. And in order to recycle it, that battery, or try to, that battery has to be completely used. So it may not be good for a car. That battery has to be used on the secondary market to maybe store energy. But afterwards when it's dead, like batteries in your remote control, you throw those in the garbage, which you're probably not supposed to, those can then be sent to a salvage yard. But they can't be sent to a salvage yard until they're completely zero. So people don't realize that. So now you've got these cars and you go, don't they look cool? They're so cool. Sure they are. And what do you think those cool bodies are made of? Some sort of polycarbonate. And what's in that? Fossil fuels. So people don't think about that. So I'm going to give you just a tip on fossil fuels. It's in every single thing you touch. From a piece of paper to glass, medical supplies, medicine, the clothing you wear, the computers you touch, literally every single thing you touch has some sort of product from fossil fuels. And it's mind blowing. Especially when you think about glass. You're like, glass? Yes. Even safety glass in cars because there's a film in between and that is made of some form of petroleum. So there's no way to get away with it 100%. So it may sound great in an idea. In reality it's never going to happen. So if you want to drive a Lada, which is a Russian piece of crap car, that's probably what you'd end up with if the government gets involved. Because they can't even handle the post office in Amtrak. I can't imagine them getting involved in the auto industry because it's exactly like in the UK and they destroyed the auto industry in the process of doing that. And they've already got their fingers in the US auto industry, which is concerning. So when you're looking at battery powered vehicles, you should have the choice. If you want one, you should be able to buy one. If you live in an area where I live in the city, I don't travel very far. If I do, I take mass transit, whatever it is. I take a bus, a plane, whatever. Fine. You should be able to buy one if you want one. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to buy a gasoline powered vehicle, a diesel vehicle, hydrogen, which is coming online from not just BMW, but Hyundai, a bunch of different manufacturers are working on hydrogen. That's going to be next to us of CNG and Porsche is coming up with E-gas. Very cool. Synthetic gasoline. I'm doing a ton of research on that. It's already in pre-production and right now they're figuring it's going to be around $4 a gallon, but it might be cheaper and you can put it into your old Porsche and still drive it. You put it in your old Toyota Camry from 1980 and still drive it. And I think that's really cool that people don't realize that could be the answer. And it's synthetic, like synthetic oil. It works. I love that thought process because people aren't going to get rid of their cars, especially collectible cars. And people are like, oh, they're going to get rid of every gasoline powered car in the world. Really? Who do you think buys those $35 million cars at auction? People with a lot of power. And they're not about to let the government or any politician squash their passion for automobiles. It's never going to happen. So it may sound great on the surface, but there's a lot of money and power out there and that may be okay for you, but not for them. So I don't think that's going to fly so low because it's always this, I get it, but you don't. What's good enough for me, but not for thee. You may see some of that. And that's what we're seeing right now. So these electric cars all sound great on the surface. You have to buy a charging station. It's about $2,500. That's on you to buy. And it has to be put in by a certified electrician. That's the thing. If you try to do it yourself and you do it wrong, you could burn your house down. And it's happened a lot. And it's because people think they can do it themselves. You need a certified electrician to put it in. It's going to cost you about five grand all in. Now if you have an older home, like a lot, like an old original historic home, something that's back before 1950s, you'll probably need to draw a whole new line. You may have to do a lot of new electrical work. Be prepared. So maybe you don't want to do that. Maybe you want to find charging stations, but again, not all of them work.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Having been browbeaten for decades, swathes of more than one generation has accepted our civilisations and ways of life must be surrendered, dismantled in the name of saving the earth. But then last year an organisation called CLINTEL, the Climate Intelligence Foundation, published a document called the World Climate Declaration. It was signed by over a thousand scientists and others from a scientific background. A Nobel physics laureate was among them and the declaration attracted huge attention on social media with its bold assertion that there is no climate emergency. The declaration also stated that, quote, earth's climate has varied as long as the planet has existed. With natural cold and warm phases, the little ice age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it's no surprise we're experiencing a period of warming. Needless to say, the declaration's signatories were roundly vilified and dismissed by the mainstream as having the wrong sort of scientific qualifications and were therefore not worth heeding. It's no longer good enough just to watch dissenters being hounded out of polite society, that the mainstream media laps up the talk of a world on the point of spontaneously combusting entirely because of activity by humans makes it dangerously difficult to ask questions, far less seek truthful answers. I'd go so far as to say someone's lying about the climate, deliberately lying to the people and pushing a false narrative shaped to cause fear and assure mass compliance that serves the intentions of vested interests. Last month, that same CLINTEL Foundation published damning analysis of the latest report from the International Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, the body to which most governments around the world look for climate policy advice. On the topic of predicted rises in sea level, the CLINTEL report says readings from tide gauges tipped for monitoring sea level show, quote, remarkably linear behaviour for more than a century, unquote. Simply put, despite doom-laden predictions, the sea level has barely changed in the last hundred years. And while we, the general public, are being frightened out of our wits by disaster mongering, those with the deepest pockets of all seem, judging by their actions, to harbour no such worries. In 2017, climate crisis activist John Kerry spent $11.7 million on a sprawling estate on the beach, on the beach, in Martha's Vineyard. In 2020, Bill and Melinda Gates spent $43 million on a massive house on the beach, on the beach, in Del Mar near San Diego. The Obama family have their own luxurious beachfront home. When climate alarmist Al Gore, he of an inconvenient truth, ran for US President in 2000, he was apparently worth just $1.7 million. After decades of travelling the world in private jets to frighten the wits out of the proles, he has amassed an estimated $330 million. He owns multiple properties, including an ocean view home in Montecito, California that he purchased in 2010 for nearly $9 million. Maybe those people are so wealthy they can contemplate watching such homes taken by the waves in their lifetimes, knowing they can afford to throw away tens of millions of dollars without consequence, without shedding a tear. But such contempt for sums beyond the reach of billions would hardly look good. The dear old IPCC also claims, quote, global temperatures are more likely than not unprecedented in the last 125,000 years. According to the Clintel Foundation, this ignores the well-documented event called the Holocene Thermal Maximum around 9,800 to 5,700 years ago, when evidence shows temperatures were often higher than now in many parts of the world. The IPCC ignores those inconvenient millennia altogether as though they had never happened. Furthermore, according to Clintel, the IPCC ignored crucial peer-reviewed literature showing that normalised disaster losses have decreased since 1990 and that human mortality due to extreme weather has decreased by more than 95% since 1920. To continue, the IPCC, by cherry-picking from the literature, drew the opposite conclusions, claiming increases in damage and mortality due to anthropogenic climate change, which is to say caused by us humans. Clintel insists that the latest IPCC report, Rewrote Climate History, emphasises an implausible worst-case scenario as a huge bias in favour of bad news and against good news, and keeps the good news out of the summary for policy makers. Bear in mind it's the summary for policy makers that governments like ours read and upon which base policies like Net Zero. Clintel claims to show biases and errors in every one of the IPCC report's 13 chapters. For example, a review article published in 2020 showed that 52 out of 53 peer-reviewed papers dealing with normalised disaster losses saw no increase in harms that could be attributed to climate change. The IPCC highlighted the single paper that claimed an increase in losses. That paper is unsurprisingly flawed, but its cherry-picking by the IPCC suggests they found its conclusions irresistible. But the IPCC's deafening contribution to the debate reaches the highest places. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said recently, we are on a highway to climate hell. The Clintel Foundation counters with, an in-depth look at the mortality data shows that climate-related deaths are at an all-time low. What are we ordinary mortals supposed to make of all this? In a peer-reviewed paper in 2020, economist Bjorn Lomborg published data supporting an optimistic reading of the worldwide reduction of climate-related death, and yet the IPCC chose to ignore it. Clintel added, the strategy of the IPCC seems to be to hide any good news about climate change and hype anything bad. The IPCC is addicted to its highest emissions scenario. In recent years, several papers have demonstrated that this scenario is implausible and should not be used for policy purposes. Deep inside the report, the IPCC acknowledges that this scenario has a low likelihood. This crucial remark, however, was not highlighted in the summary for policy makers, so that those important audiences were left unaware. It's the view of the Clintel Foundation that nothing less than the wholesale reform of the IPCC is now required, specifically to include alternative views. If, for some reason, such inclusion of different views is unacceptable, they say the IPCC should be dismantled. If we really aren't in the midst of a climate crisis, if one road leads to the unnecessary dismantling of our civilization while the other leads to salvation, isn't it crucial that we pause for a moment to consider all the facts, not just those serving one side?'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Rice cultivation, crop residues, natural gas wells, landfills, coal mining, various industrial processes and many many other things all emit methane. What we want to know is how much of that methane came from cows. Kurzgesagt doesn't tell us that. Instead they say the methane science is controversial and switch topics.

The energy from this influence is destabilizing our planet's core, leading to magma heating and causing a surge in cataclysms on Earth. But what's even worse is that this heating that's happening right now is heating exponentially, accelerating due to the dying ocean, as we've discussed. And everything is heading towards a global catastrophe, unlike anything in Earth's history, and our humanity has never seen before. Now let's answer the question together. What should we all do? What should every single one of us do? Indeed, to avoid such a scenario that culminates in a global catastrophe for everyone, humanity needs to halt or deflect this external cosmic influence. Again, we've discussed these things. The force currently attacking the core of our planet from space. So what's required to stop this? Naturally, it needs to be studied. It's nature, understood. And a way to affect it must be found. How to do that, you might ask. Well, this force is an unexplored stream of particles coming from the depths of space. So the solution lies in the realm of physics. Therefore, the answer to the question that we all ask, how to do it, seems self-evident. Our science needs to tackle this issue, thoroughly study this energy, and discover how to stop it for each and every single one of us.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Everyone's like under the impression that with climate change, the world's gonna slowly heat up and the ocean levels are gonna slowly rise and it'll just slowly become uninhabitable.

And the way it works is, is you gotta imagine that you're in a canoe and one jackass is just like rocking back and forth, right? And the canoe keeps tipping more and more to the left and to the right. Well, eventually it tips too far and then it just completely flips, right? That's called the canoe tipping theory.

Then once that happens, there won't be a transfer of heat, which you're thinking, oh my God, everything will get so hot. No, everything will get fucking cold. I don't wanna double check it, but I'm pretty sure that the UK is at the same latitude as Siberia. So they'll have the same environment.

Apple is apparently so concerned about climate change that they literally came out against the existence of life itself on planet Earth. They either did this on purpose or out of their own stupidity. So, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, posted this video on his Twitter account in which they virtue-signal about Apple's efforts to fight back against climate change. It's a very weird and creepy video where they have Octavius Spencer play the role of Mother Nature and have her talk to the Apple staff in a corporate board meeting where all of Apple's employees talk about what they've done to reach net-zero emissions. But the weirdest part of this video came towards the end where one of Apple's board members literally says that their goal is to remove all carbon from Earth's atmosphere. Grasslands in Kenya. Why? Our aim is to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere. What about your water usage? We've reduced it by- Hold on a second. Our goal is to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere, which is literally essential to having life on planet Earth. That thing that is literally found in almost everything that exists, that every cell in the human body relies on in order to, like, be alive. Apparently, Apple wants to remove that. You know, you got to admire them. Destroying all life on Earth is quite a lofty goal. And what is life without setting huge goals and striving to achieve them? Meanwhile, Apple is also still fully in bed with the Chinese Communist Party, complicit in the genocide of Uyghurs, as well as China's regime of censorship. China, which you know is literally the biggest polluter in the world still, that are burning more coal every single day. By the way, did you know that the climate change economy is also reliant on slave labor? Because all of the rechargeable batteries found in things like smartphones and electric cars are powered by cobalt, which is mined by thousands of workers in slave-like conditions in Africa, including thousands of child laborers. And they have to cut down millions of trees in order to do this. But we're doing it all to save the planet, you see. And apparently, climate change is just so bad that Apple just wants all life on Earth to cease to exist.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

If we have an increase in all of the disastrous effects of climate change, why is that good? So if we have an increase in sea level, if we have an increase in droughts... If we have, as the Met Office said, even in the article we referred to today, if the Met Office is saying that we get these more disastrous rain pours in the winter in the UK, and we get hotter summers, none of these things...

And we could have fill up our reservoirs, brilliant. But nobody wanted the 40 degrees, and... Well, no, we don't want 40, although, to be fair, if we're going to have 40 degrees, then let's just get air con. Look, look, I also find this pointless, because what we want is rain coming over a period of time where we can absorb it into the ground, and our reservoirs can pick it up. Not that it comes like this in a very short space of time, and then it doesn't get absorbed into the reservoirs very easily and everything else. I'm sorry. And I don't know why you laugh. I find it so funny that you laugh at these things. Given that we have had a 99% fall in the number of people who get killed by natural disasters, by climate, why is that a problem?

No, no, more people die from colds than from heat by a factor of... Nine times more people die from colds even in Africa than die from heat. But, Julia, why are you hung up?

There are plenty of scientists who question whether it is happening and is as a result of man in the majority. Plenty of scientists do that. This 99% nonsense is a load of nonsense. But also, is it a problem? There is actually plenty of evidence that it's not a problem. Julia, Julia, you completely missed out the opportunity. What we have to agree on is the opportunity. What we also have to agree on is where things are going. Those green jobs. No, no, no. Forget the word green in this for a minute. Just talk industry and opportunity. And look at the fact that whether or not we believe in climate change... It's not about believing. You don't have to believe in anything. It's either a fact or it's not.

The auroral displays are completely out of control, and if we weren't several years into Clown World, I'd be shocked the media isn't discussing it. We mentioned it this morning, the 2003 Halloween solar superstorm produced low-latitude aurora down to the southernmost states. This has happened before, but not often, and it takes major X-class solar flares, extreme speed CME plasma striking Earth, and top-level geomagnetic storms. I went ahead and looked up the times that aurora were seen in the southernmost states, and here is a brief list going back to the Carrington event of 1859. The top lines are ones that happened in the same solar cycle. They certainly seem to be getting more common as time goes on, even as light pollution makes them harder and harder to see. This fact alone is a signal that Earth's aurora are getting more extreme, and with the fact that solar activity is not breaking any records, it confronts normalcy bias and reminds us this is exactly what we are expecting as Earth's magnetic field weakens in the ongoing excursion and magnetic pulse shift. From 2018 to 2020, we said over and over, we'll be needing to closely monitor the aurora in the upcoming solar cycle to see if the trend continues. Just this year we've had several events. In September, a solar storm which was not major, which was not triggered by an extreme speed shockwave, and which had no X-class solar flare, caused the auroral activity to be visible from Arizona. The same thing happened in August, once again no X-class flare, the solar wind was moderately strong at best, and the geomagnetic storm didn't even hit KP7. But aurora were visible in Arizona nonetheless. The storm in April was fairly strong but still not at the top level disruption, still no mega CME or X-class flares, and yet the aurora were visible in Mexico and southern Texas. It happened in March as well, again, from a solar event that was only moderately strong, but which produced a fairly strong geomagnetic storm, still not top level, yet aurora were visible from New Mexico, and a few reports even came in from Florida. Folks, there has never been any year where far southern aurora were seen as many times as we've just had. This is a record, and the year's not over yet. What's worse is that the geomagnetic storms have not hit the top level disruption, and the solar activity that triggered them was moderately strong at best. We've said it before, let's say it again. The Earth is becoming more and more vulnerable to solar activity. I would never deny the significance of the ongoing economic issues, potential for World War III, loss of freedom due to governments and the World Economic Forum pulling their agenda 2030 nonsense, but folks, despite the evidence being right in our faces, the media is completely ignoring what is happening to the Earth. The magnetic pole shift and geomagnetic excursion are progressing, and in the coming years we're going to lose all modern technology and the foundations of modern civilization. It doesn't get much worse than this, especially since other real global issues seem to be overshadowing it completely in the public forum. We've seen this evidence in the magnetic field itself, the polar motion, the ionosphere and the atmosphere. Alas, now an auroral record has fallen. The sun isn't doing anything crazy, so it once again shows us another sign that Earth's geospheres are in big trouble, and us along with them. I'll see you in the morning for the Daily Show. Be safe, everyone.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

He wrote down that he was flying north, and what he saw was a mountain range. So he went over to it, and after he crossed it, he said he saw this green valley with like a river or a stream running through it.

He says he descends down and starts to see grass, and then in the distance he sees a huge animal, and at first he can't tell what it is, but as he gets closer, he claims he saw a mammoth. As he keeps flying, he sees building-like structures, and when he gets closer, he realizes it's a city. At this point, he was probably just in shock and disbelief because he said this is impossible.

However, it's obvious that this warming is, first of all, affected by the magma uplift. Yeah, right. And now let's talk about the second piece of evidence that the magma is rising, which is the heating of the lower layers of the atmosphere, oceans, and glaciers due to the new magma rivers are formed, eroding the mantle and approaching the crust. The Global Atmospheric Research Institutions have determined that one of the regions where the increase in temperature has been growing two to three times faster than the average of the planet is the territory of Siberia. It was in this direction that the course shifted in 1998. Because of this, magma beneath Siberia rose to the surface fastest. And now, there is a huge magma chamber burning its way through the crust in Siberia. Heating of the Earth's interior leads to abnormal melting of permafrost and gas explosions under the ice. In the Arctic part of Siberia, winter fires have appeared under the snow. And in the areas above fractures, the icy water in drinking well became hot. And the frequency and the intensity of earthquakes are increasing. Let's now listen to Dr. Egon Chalakyan about this. Dr. Chalakyan is a visiting researcher at Harvard University, particle physicist, international tax law and intellectual property law professional with a national security background. There are extreme increases in geothermal anomalies in Siberia. The number of gas emission craters is increasing in the northern regions with intensified methane and hydrogen emissions being realized from the inner Earth. In the event you have not yet noticed, mud volcanism on the Arctic shelf is becoming significantly more pronounced. All these facts unanimously point out that the dynamic warming of Siberia today, which is two to three times faster than the rest of the world, is primarily due to an increase in endogenous heat. Heat coming from the Earth's depths. Siberia is warming from below. As a result of the core's pressure towards Timir, deep magnetic headspots formed beneath Siberia, actively lifting magma closer to the junctions of the lithospheric plates. Consequently, heat accumulated beneath Siberia's upper mantle layers, and the thin lithospheric crust started the process of melting from the magma. In essence, the rates of lithospheric melting are accelerating due to the increasing temperatures and fluidity of the magma itself. So what now awaits us? The uncomplicated, simple, vividly clear answer is, simply place a cube of ice on a heated stove. What happens? The ice melts quickly. In the same manner the heated magma erodes the plate, which melts just like our ice cube. It's that simple. This is what is happening right now beneath Siberia. Continuation of this unchecked process will lead to just one highly predictable outcome. A global catastrophe capable of destroying not only Russia, but also the entire world.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

It does change. There's very little evidence that humans are making much impact. And as far as CO2 is concerned, which is the major focus, that's probably more good than bad. CO2, you know quite a bit about it. Is it all negative? And if not, then what are the benefits? Well, I think the main benefit of CO2 is it's the food for plants. It's the food for the plants. Plants really need three things. They need light for photosynthesis. They need water. And they need CO2. Plants are made of carbon. When I hear about carbon pollution, we're all made of carbon. Plants are made of carbon. People are made of carbon. Your hamburger is made of carbon. But CO2 is used by plants. If you go to a cornfield, for example, in midsummer and you measure CO2, it's about half what it would be at night because the corn plant has sucked so much CO2 out of the air that it's now limited on how fast it can make new sugar and grow by the amount of CO2. So if you double the CO2, the corn can grow better. There's more of it there. It doesn't suck it down so quickly. So that's number one is it's an essential plant food. And the other thing is it gives drought resistance to plants because a plant has this problem that when it gets CO2, it doesn't suck it up from the roots. It has to open up little holes in its leaf. And so CO2 molecule bounces around and other air molecules gets into the hole. For every CO2 that goes into this hole, a hundred water molecules may diffuse out from the interior of the plant. So the plant is squandering water as it's trying to make food from photosynthesis. So if you look at, say, a gram of sugar, to make a gram of sugar takes a hundred grams of water. So there's huge amounts of water used in photosynthesis now, more than should be because we're essentially in a CO2 famine, if you look at it. We're in a CO2 famine. Famine, famine. We have too little CO2.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Yet, in the past six months, this phenomenon has been seen over Central Europe, the Middle Belts of Russia, the Southern United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Typically, polar lights are dominated by green color, but now the sky is increasingly flashing with shades of red, and this is a troubling signal. As red light indicates the glow of oxygen in the lower atmosphere, such auroras indicate that the magnetic field continues to weaken, allowing more and more solar and other more dangerous types of radiation to penetrate into Earth from outer space. Now, we are witnessing the appearance and growth of other magnetic anomalies, magnetic hooks and cracks, coronal glow, and Stevies, light pillars rising from the ground, as well as other phenomena.

Some climate scientists believe this is a strategy that should be used to cool the Earth by increasing the reflectivity of the sun.

And then, you know Greta Thunberg showed up and I thought oh, well, there we go Now we've got we've got the the thirteen-year-old. I feel sorry for her, you know, because She was chased into this Apocalyptic terror that we're trying to enforce on all our kids and then you think about her position, you know So now she's all afraid and her mother's facilitating that like mad and then you know She announces her fear her neurotic fear. Essentially. It's driven by negative emotion and you know Macron says to her. Oh my god Greta. You're absolutely right bows It's like what the hell is a girl to think? You know because what she really wants is to freak out a bit and for someone calm and reasonable to say hey look kid You know The apocalypse has always been on us. It's always the case that the future has the possibility of being dreadful, but you know, we've Conquered terrible things in the past and overcome massive obstacles and there's no reason at all not to assume that we can do the same thing That's a very important point. Well, yeah It's it's such an important point because there's never been a time ever or everything was perfect. Well, that's for sure There's never been a time ever Environmentally where the earth was stable. No, if you go, I mean stable, you know currently kind of like guess what the weather's gonna be But if you look at like models of like thousands of years, it's never been flat It's always been up and down heat. So the earth was a nice ball many times many times. Yeah, so yeah Yeah well Randall Carlson was saying there's been times in our like distant past where The co2 levels and the oxygen levels were so fucked up that we were close to losing all life on earth, right? right, and then this yeah, well see the the antithesis to that is to believe in something like the Paradisal the intrinsic paradisal stability of well-balanced mother nature, right? It's like yeah a bit but no not really There's a lot of variability a lot and of course that kind of variability That's hard on people because you want a certain amount of stability so you don't die, right? It doesn't deny that human beings have an impact on this either No, no Well, this is why like this is why I really respect Bjorn Lomborg, you know Because Lomborg's hard to grasp because he forces you to think complexly, you know, he says well we don't have one problem Carbon dioxide which is you know, I don't even think it's clear that carbon dioxide is actually a problem But we can leave that aside that'll get me in trouble with the College of psychologists again But you know Lomborg says look founder. Yeah, it's a it's a factor Yeah, yeah but there's lots of factors and God only knows what the most pressing problems that confront us truly are when I I wandered through the Ecological sustainability literature about ten years ago and you know, I concluded a couple of things One was that the best way forward to a sustainable planet? Is to make everyone who's poor rich as fast as he possibly can and that's Lomborg's Not to put limits to growth on because it turns out if you get people above about five thousand dollars a year in average GDP They start taking long-term view of the future instead of scrabbling around in the dirt trying to get lunch, you know, and you're gonna burn everything up around you to stay alive if you have to right but if you if you got a bit of Wealth and now you can think over, you know, maybe a 20-year period which is quite the damn luxury Then you actually start being concerned about you know, the quality the aesthetic quality the local environment And so I was so excited when I found that data because I thought oh, this is so cool It means that we could have our cake and eat it too. We could work really hard to provide cheap Reliable energy, you know at the lowest cost possible to the widest number of people worldwide and the emergent consequence of that would be the whole Planet would clean itself up. So that wouldn't that be great because we could make our goal the eradication of absolute poverty Which we actually done pretty good at eliminating over the last 15 years but we could really make that a goal and then one of the consequences of that inevitable consequences would be a greener and Healthier planet and then you think well, why aren't we doing that and that's a question All right, and I think part of the reason is I've been trying to understand the driving ideas underneath this globalist utopian tyranny that seems to be developing from the top down and I think it's driven at least in part by this religious vision that Already described, you know that you have to construe culture itself Especially industrial culture as the tyrannical father raping and pillaging everything in its way, which is unbelievably dangerous way to think to one-sided and the the the idea that you have to impose limits to growth on people in order to have a Sustainable planet and that's allied with a view that probably stems all the way back to people like Paul Ehrlich in the 1960s who really believe really believe Truly that maybe the planet should only have 500 million people on it or a billion, you know in relative poverty or two billion barely Scraping by because otherwise they're gonna be wrecking everything and you know controlled by some top-down authority that makes bloody Well sure that no one's consuming too much And so when I look at ideas like that that first assumption, you know, the planet has too many people on it It's like I don't like to hear people say that because when I hear that I think okay, buddy Who exactly are you thinking about getting rid of? Oh, well, it's not like that. It's like yeah, it's like that It has to be like it is absolutely like that So, you know, it's easy to get all paranoid conspiracy theorist about the WEF say and maybe there's some utility in that But you know, I don't think anybody's sitting at Davos going. Well, we got a scrap 7 billion people But if the underlying narrative is the one I just described, you know Virginal planet tyrannical patriarchy and rapacious individual and you believe well we're overpopulated like Paul Ehrlich has believed since really literally the mid-1960s then How is it not going to be that the policies that you craft? stemming from that narrative are colored by the belief that there's far too many people like I've already felt that I'd be that war for the last six months and I would say it's war because What I observed happening in Europe when I was there last was that well, you can see this You don't have to be in Europe to see it But it's more direct if you're there is that it's pretty damn clear that the globalist Utopians are willing to sacrifice the poor for the sake of the planet, you know And they're doing that by cranking energy prices up through the roof. And that means that people die Lombard is estimated that Three may be after your thermostat down by three degrees right save the planet. We don't have enough energy We'll pay you not to use your electricity between five and six, which is what they're doing in the UK You turn your damn thermostat down three degrees. That sounds like nothing But if you're old that radically increases the probability that you'll get a respiratory disease and die You know and if the Europeans would have had a cold winter and that could still happen Lombard estimated wipe out a hundred and thirty five thousand people. It's like well, you know, we're just making energy more expensive It's like what do you mean? You're just doing that. So imagine the economic system. It's a pyramid There's a bunch of people at the top They have almost all the money that's par for the course for any productive system any system That's productive ends up with a distribution like that It's pretty it's like a law of nature and then you move farther down the pyramid till you get down to the bottom Where most of the people are and they're barely clinging on to the edge of reality, right? It doesn't take much of a crisis to tip them into you know death and then you crank up energy prices Well, what happens is you just take a bunch of those people at the bottom of the distribution the poor that the left is so You know hypothetically concerned with and you just they're just done'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Shortly after, a solar superstorm strikes Springfield, a silent, invisible tempest sweeping through the town, causing severe consequences. This catastrophic event leads to a complete shutdown. No internet, no electricity, everything comes to a standstill. A solar superstorm could wipe out the internet for weeks, or even months, or even forever. The portrayal of a solar superstorm in the episode aligns with the potential real-world impact such an event could have. Interestingly, NASA has recently made a shocking discovery, a massive hole in the sun called the Coronel Hole. This hole, large enough to engulf 60 Earth-sized planets, is currently releasing solar storms at a staggering speed of 1.8 million miles per hour, and could be headed to Earth fast. The last time the Earth experienced such a storm was in 1859. It was known as the Carrington Event. The 2024 solar storm is predicted to be 60 times more powerful than the 1859 solar storm, possibly the strongest ever recorded in history.

We drilled down like eight miles and we had to stop because it got too hot. Out of 4,000 miles basically to the core of the Earth, we went down eight. That's nothing. We have more than 70 active space programs right now. We can tell you more about the surface of the moon than we can the surface underneath our own oceans. Since we have not actually drilled down far enough to confirm these findings, could it be that we may be wrong about the composition of our own Earth? Some ancient astronaut theorists say yes and suggest that according to our earliest mythologies, an other Earth might not be found in the heavens, but deep within our own planet.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

At least not the climate change they've been telling you about. If you want context, click on this comment and check out the video. Y'all know what's happening in California right now with all the rain. Y'all know what happened in Buffalo a couple weeks ago. And every other weather anomaly that's happened in the last five years. Here's what's happening. The sun is entering a solar maximum. We are currently moving into the galactic particle sheet. And the Earth's magnetic field is weakening at a dramatic rate. On top of that, our magnetic poles are shifting to South America and India. This is why we've been able to see the aurora borealis as low as the Midwest in America. This is why you're starting to see a lot more sprites. It's the lightning that comes down like a tree. And why every 12,000 years everything disappears in the geological record. There is a cataclysm cycle that occurs on this planet. It has to do with this galactic sheet of electricity and particles that we pass through every 12,000 years. The sun's solar maximum matching up with that every 12,000 years. And the Earth's weakening magnetic field due to a natural pole shift that occurs every 12,000 years. The reason woolly mammoths are found frozen in the Arctic, fully intact with food still in their stomach, is because they were flash frozen. At that time, the Earth shifted 90 degrees and new poles were created overnight. I'm talking 100 degree drop in temperature. It's going to happen again in South America and India. That's why you're seeing massive migrations of animals away from these areas. Just check out the elephants in West Asia. There's a book called the Adam and Eve story. This book meticulously details what happened then and what's going to happen in the future. It was so scary and accurate the CIA classified it for years. When Jesus said no stone would be left unturned, he was talking about this cataclysm. If this was really about man-made climate change, he wouldn't have an uptick in volcanoes and earthquakes. Because there's so much electricity in the atmosphere because the Earth can't block it out, tons of groundwater is being pulled from deep within the Earth and brought into the atmosphere. Therefore, we're going to have torrential downpours more and more, and we're going to get Noah's floods. The man-made climate change story is an effort to keep everyone calm as the weather gets crazier and crazier. We'll keep blaming ourselves or fossil fuels, and we'll think it's eventually going to pass or it's just going to come to us really slowly. That's not how it's going to happen. It's going to get worse and worse and worse, and then like a switch going off. The whole world is going to be thrown into chaos. I'd advise you start doing some serious research. I'm going to tag an account of a guy that knows a lot about this. I also suggest that you check out Suspicious Observers on YouTube. This guy, Ben, really knows what he's talking about too, and he's educating people on how to stay safe. There are safe areas that you can go. They're not perfectly safe, but they're much better than being on top of Yosemite when it goes off or when the mile-high tsunamis come.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Interesting. I'm going to give you a little Jenga piece to pull out of that puzzle to make it a little bit more wobbly right now. I was at the beach this morning and I captured a lovely, lovely sight. Check it out. So it looks like it's coming up, but if you zoom in, you can see it's already up. There's just too much atmosphere that is making it lens, so it's blowing it up and it looks like it's actually rising. Instead, perspective works. As the further thing gets away, the lower it's going to go. Just like if you see streetlights miles and miles down the road, they're not going to be up like here above your head. They're going to be down just like this. It's just perspective. That's not actually going down. It's going further away, and the lensing from the atmosphere is blowing it up. If you zoomed in on this, it would be just exactly like my video. Here's just another beautiful example of that is going straight, just farther away, but it looks like it's going down, just like the Sun. Beautiful example. It's just how perspective in the human eye works. This guy is walking straight, and look how it looks like he's going to be going down. That's just a straight field he's walking on. He's not walking downhill. He's not working on a curved surface. We're not spinning. It's just perspective, guys. It's just how it works. That's how the human eye works and literally just how perspective works. People teach us this in school because it would lead us to realize some bigger things. This is what the Sun is actually doing. It's what causes days. It's what causes seasons. It's what causes time zones. You see, we're not rotating 360 degrees in a day. The Sun is rotating around us in 24 hours, and that's what causes a day. It's also what causes seasons. If this is the United States, the Sun makes smaller loops around the Earth in the summer, and then as the winter starts to come, it makes these bigger ones, and then Australia has the summer because it's closer to Australia and further away from us. I really want you to sit with this one, okay? We were told that the Sun comes up because of the Earth's rotation. If that was true, when we see that half of a Sun, I shouldn't be able to zoom in on it, okay? Half of it's covered or a quarter. I shouldn't be able to zoom in and then look. It's here. It's just all perspective, and you need to change your perspective to a new one and realize that we're not spinning. Not at all.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

It's a very delicate topic because people often hear what they want to hear when we talk about these things. So I'm a degreed geologist. I've been studying climate and geology as well as magnetic fields of the Earth since the 1970s, when I first realized we were keeping records of the Earth's magnetic fields, for example. And as a geologist, I've had the opportunity and I have the skills to look into the past and see if Earth is broken. Are we broken right now? Is this truly an anomalous time? Nature works in vast cycles and expanses of time. Nature doesn't work like in a five-year cycle necessarily or a 10-year cycle. So what I have been able to see and what I share in the programs is that if you look at the ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland, each year there's a new layer of ice that is deposited that contains atmospheric information, dust particles from volcanoes, little air bubbles that it captures in the ice that have the carbon dioxide for that particular year in that air bubble. So we can go back into those ice cores and we can reconstruct climate. And the ice cores in Antarctica, the deepest core now goes back over 420,000 years before present. Humans, anatomically modern humans, showed up on the Earth and signed this degree to this timeline 200,000 years ago. So that means there was 220,000, 240,000 years before humans ever showed up. We have these records for it. And if you look at the cycles, they're the same cycles. Climate is cyclic. And I've been saying this now for over 40 years, asking us to prepare for the climate change rather than trying to think that we can somehow prevent the climate change. So where are we right now? We are precisely where I would expect we should be. There is a warming on the planet. It is a relatively small warming compared to what we have seen in the past. If you look at the cores from the past, the warmings are intense, they're brief. And after the warming, it's what comes after that is usually the bigger problem, is the cooling cycle. There's evidence now that we are moving into a cooling cycle. Doesn't mean an ice age, doesn't mean like Hollywood, you know, everything's gonna freeze over. But even a little shift in climate globally changes the weather locally. It changes when it rains, when it snows, when you plant the crops, when you can harvest the crops. In the northern hemisphere, where most of the food of the world is grown, this is significant. You know, just a small half a degree Celsius can change all kinds of things, surface temperature as well as ocean temperatures. So the bottom line for me is climate change is a fact. And I don't see how anyone could possibly deny that. Humans did not cause it. Humans are contributing by kicking the carbon dioxide into the air. But this is where it gets really interesting. There was a scientific study, it's called the Inconvenience Study, that is not being shared.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

HAARP is the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project, originally a joint effort of the Air Force and Navy in cooperation with a number of academic institutions. HAARP is comprised of 180 antennas, approximately 72 feet tall, linked together to function as one giant steerable antenna. Steerable because it can aim millions of watts of ELF waves into one tiny patch of the atmosphere. The amount of energy we're talking about here is 3.6 million watts, injecting their entire output into a spot that's about 12 miles across by about 2.5 miles deep by about 90 miles up. This is where HAARP is pointed. It's an area located roughly 300 miles from Anchorage. The U.S. military says HAARP is merely being used to study the physical and electrical properties and behavior of the ionosphere for both civilian and defense purposes. Another theory has surfaced. The intense energy being beamed into the sky by HAARP is actually heating up the atmosphere, causing weather changes. HAARP is being used for weather modification. The military's own record proves it. They've admitted it within their own documents, and yet they still deny it to the public. HAARP is one of several ELF wave transmitters located all over the globe. The United States owns and operates three of them, one in Gakona, Alaska, another in Fairbanks, Alaska, and one in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Russia has one in Vasilursky near Nizhny Novgorod, and the European Union has one near Troms\u00f8 in Norway. Working in tandem, these transmitters could potentially alter the weather anywhere in the world, changing the jet stream's course entirely, triggering massive rainstorms or droughts. Even hurricane steering would be possible by heating up the atmosphere and building up high-pressure domes that could deflect or change the course of hurricanes.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

It shows that cows are far from the highest emitter of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalents in the environment. What are the major culprits? Transportation, electricity generation, burning coal, and technology. Those industries are trying to distract you by blaming these guys. But these animals provide humans with some of the best food on the planet. If we truly want to take care of humans and take care of the planet, we will have more cows raised properly like this in a regenerative fashion, and we will discard the lies that these animals had any meaningful contribution to climate change at all.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

The three jet aircraft visible in this film footage are C-17 Globemasters. The only entities that possess these aircraft, C-17s, are military. What you see occurring in this video are US military cargo tanker aircraft dispersing materials into the atmosphere. We're officially told by government agencies and by the entire science community that climate engineering operations are only a proposal. We are told that if climate engineering, geoengineering, solar radiation management programs were to be deployed as a last-ditch measure against the unfolding climate collapse, that it would be done with jet aircraft that would spray tens of millions of tons of reflective toxic heavy metal and polymer particulates into the atmosphere annually. We're told this atmospheric spraying, if it were to be deployed, would look exactly like what we are already seeing in our skies. Yet we are told that what we are seeing, we are not really seeing. How long has the US government been experimenting with and developing methods to spray particulates into the skies? For nearly 100 years, as this patent for artificial cloud creation from the 1920s reveals, and as the nearly 100-year-old biplane spraying demonstration makes clear. Even now, as our skies are so often crisscrossed with lingering, expanding emissions from jet aircraft geoengineering dispersions, sometimes covering the entire horizon, we're emphatically told by all official sources that climate engineering operations are, as stated earlier, only a proposal, and that anyone who says otherwise is a, quote, conspiracy theorist. Question, what are we to believe? The official lies, pushed on us by an ever more desperate power structure, or what we can see with our own eyes? The ongoing global climate engineering solar radiation management operations are nothing short of weather and biological warfare against completely unsuspecting populations all over the world. We're told geoengineering programs are our last hope to slow down the unfolding climate collapse. But after over 70 years of the covert climate engineering onslaught, all available data makes clear that man's attempt to play God with Earth's climate and life support systems is, in reality, further fueling the climate collapse overall, not mitigating it. The climate engineering atrocities are the greatest and most immediate threat we collectively face, short of nuclear cataclysm.

It is coffee time, so let's sit down and talk about this whole eclipse thing. I went off on a little bit of a tangent in my research, and I have a theory. So if that's something you'd like to listen to, grab something to drink and spend a minute with me. So I started asking myself, why is this one so important? Why are they putting out school closures? Why are they putting out warnings that, you know, stay off the roads because it might not be safe and all of this kind of stuff? And as I started looking at previous eclipse dates, and hopefully you guys can hear me okay with the stereo from a boat down in the bay there, it's a little ways away, it's a very good stereo, I started looking into previous solar eclipses. And that led me down the road to the CIA website, which is fantastic for information. And I realized that it has something to do with the magnetism of the Earth, which has everything to do with a pole shift and all that kind of stuff, so stay with me. Now when a solar flare happens, what it does is it actually demagnetizes us to a degree. In all the reports, the last one I looked at was in the 1970s. There was a solar flare in 1979, I believe, something around there. And they measured it, and it only adjusted the Earth's magnetic force very minimally. But we all know on a quantum scale, minimal can be massive, right? And it specifically mentioned, a couple of reports that I read, specifically mentioned that because certain rocks, like granite, in the Earth, and granite is everywhere you guys, like it's absolutely everywhere, it holds magnetism. So when there is a solar flare, and that magnetism is affected by lessening the gravitational force and the magnetism in the Earth, we could be looking at potentially a massive earthquake or earthquakes. And that would explain all of the bunker activity. That would explain why everybody is so worried about being prepared on this one in particular, because maybe what we're going to receive from the sun's blast, when we have a solar flare followed by the eclipse, maybe that's what's going to happen. Maybe it's about the magnetism of the Earth shifting, like noticeably, and that would also have an effect on our magnetic poles, right? That's just one theory. Here's theory two. Now this three days of darkness, aside from all the conspiracy theories and all that, is apparently because we're going to be going through a photon belt. And that is why the sun will appear to disappear for 72 hours to five days. So three to five days, which is why they're telling us to prepare and all this kind of stuff, right? The darkness days. It will affect everything. There will be no solar power. There will be, it's going to be weird. It's going to be weird. And it happens, it has happened in the past. So we know that the likelihood of it happening again is very high. So yeah, so those are the biggest possibilities that I can come up with that are based on scientific research and past events that would make us believe that a future event is possible and could be worse than the other ones. That's originally why I started going down the hole, was to find out when the last solar eclipse has happened, what were the major events of the world that happened around the same time so that we could see what the effects were of the solar flare, right? And of the eclipse itself. So yeah, this one's really interesting, you guys. So in the meantime, we should always be prepared for any emergency at all times anyways. And if you're not, then start thinking about it. Nothing we can do about the sun. And if it does cause massive earthquakes, be aware of where you are on the tectonic plate zones. You can easily find that out by watching Dutch Sense over on YouTube. Find some people that do earthquake prediction and reporting daily, and you'll find out exactly where you are on the plate zones, right? Especially for those of you in Canada and the US coming up to this April 8th eclipse that's going to go right over a significant part of the eastern part of the United States and exits out of the eastern islands in Canada, okay? So be prepared, you guys. Don't freak out. We have been through many end-of-the-world events, everything's still fine, but we can't deny that things are getting a little bit more extreme. So just be cautious, get out of your emotional zone, research, think, use your thinking, okay? And reach out if you're struggling. There's a lot going on right now, you guys, okay? Don't panic. It's okay to laugh during the apocalypse, so get some joy in your life. I love you guys. Talk to you later. Let me know what you think in the comments. '''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

But the two most important ones in the affirmative causation of climate change sector, and that would be rather than the erroneous claims about CO2 and other things, would be volcanoes and the relationship between the sun and earth modulated by the magnetic field. We recently hit the big volcano news that the top scientists in the world are now saying that volcanic impacts are likely vastly underestimated in modern climate models, so let's unpack that a bit here. This is the volcanic cooling release that is used in modern climate models, covering the same time period that they choose for temperature monitoring as well. So what's the problem with that? Well, we have both temperature and volcanic evidence going back much further in time, it just doesn't make their story look too good. This is the data for volcanoes, and the green bracketed area on the right is the time used for climate models, the modern measuring stick. As you can see, that is not really a representative sample for the earth. Volcanoes can do much more than the climate models suggest, and beyond that, the last megawarming period was in the first millennium AD, while major cooling occurred from the 1300s until about 1850. Then, the volcanic cooling disappeared and the planet has gotten warmer. Not really the message they want to send, but there's more, because when the volcanoes cut our atmosphere a break, at the same time, earth's magnetic field began its modern pole shift and weakening of magnetic protection of the planet. That means more solar energy entering the system at the same time as our natural cooling mechanism minimized, and it goes well beyond sunlight. As we saw last month, the major study on solar climate forcing showed that about 80% of the sun's impact on climate is not related to irradiance, sunlight, but to the particle forcing in magnetic fields. The protons, electrons, their direct joule heating of the atmosphere, and their ozone destruction which does let in more irradiance heating. The primary climate effect of the weakening magnetic field is its effect on the ozone, where those more particles that are penetrating into the atmosphere are causing a decline in the ozone and a thinning, which causes those cascading impacts. That is a double whammy that more than fully explains modern global warming, or at least it would if they would let it into the modeling, which they don't. Again, there are a lot of other items to cover in the climate debate. The problems with focusing on CO2, the ocean uptake, lagged forcing, cloud impact uncertainty, not to mention the uncertainty with aerosols. But from that affirmative causation standpoint, volcanoes are a big one. They aren't represented well in the models, and when we look at the actual data, it's clear they really, really should be. Especially with the timing of the warming and cooling periods. Furthermore, as they recently diminished and stopped cooling the atmosphere, the planetary magnetic field began letting in more solar energy, which we are learning has ever important impacts on the climate through both direct and indirect means. If you can't dive deep into the hundreds of aspects of the climate discussion, at least remember these two things. Volcanoes and the magnetic shift of Earth as it relates to the sun. I'll see you in the morning for the Daily Show. Be safe, everyone.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

A new study by the Journal of Natural Science says that if by the end of the century, climate change will total up to 83 million deaths because of climate-related causes. Yeah, they're wrong. Sorry, go ahead. Continue, but I'll explain why. Go ahead. I'm wondering, Ben, why you believe that climate change is not an emergency. Okay, because they're wrong. So, now, here's the... Sorry, I didn't let you answer the question mark. The reason that they're wrong is because all of these studies are done in the absence of mitigating measures. So, as I've said before, when I talk about climate change, when you're talking about climate change, there are a couple of things human beings can do. And by the way, I accept IPCC estimates. They range from sort of the mild, like 1.5 degrees Celsius, all the way up to the not very mild, like 4 degrees Celsius, again, over the course of the century. And because there is this range, the more extreme versions of this, the 4 degrees Celsius, whenever you read the IPCC reports, which I have, when you read those reports, they say in them that they have very low confidence that some of the more catastrophic sort of predictions are going to occur. They will say low to moderate confidence. The less catastrophic predictions, they'll say more like high confidence or fair or high confidence, that kind of stuff. Okay, here is the thing. When people suggest that there is not going to be any sort of mitigation measures, this is wrong, or adaptation. So there's two ways you can deal with it. One is mitigation, which is we all stop driving cars, we stop using electricity, we don't have kids anymore, right, we really cut down on our carbon usage in ways that are catastrophic to the world economy. And what it really mostly does is it says to people in the developing world, hey, you're screwed. Because those are the people who really need carbon-based emissions. It's very easy for those of us who live in extraordinarily prosperous societies to say, you know what, I'm cutting down my carbon emissions a little bit because we live in very prosperous societies. Carbon-based energy is by far the most efficient form of energy on the planet, and it's worthwhile to notice that people who are living in developing or undeveloped countries, those people are still in large part burning things like dung for fuel, which is not only carbon-intensive but also a horrifying way to live, and telling those people you can't use carbon-based energy is a mistake. In order for us to take the mitigation measures that would be necessary in order to dramatically lower the trajectory of global climate change, you'd have to get China to sign on, which they will not. You'd have to get India to sign on, which they will not. Those are the two largest carbon-based emitters on planet Earth, and we live in a geopolitical world in which a carbon emission from China counts the same as a carbon emission from the United States. Which says, again, this doesn't mean there's nothing we can do, it means what we ought to be doing is the thing that will prevent the 83 million deaths, which is why I'm very confident it will prevent the 83 million deaths, adaptation. This means, for example, that we build seawalls. The simple fact of the matter is that New Orleans exists below sea level. When the seawalls, when levees were breached because the levees were poorly built, it killed 10,000 people. When the levees, last time around, this last year, there was a major hurricane, it swept directly through the exact same area, and pretty much no one was killed. The reason being, the levees were much better built. When you're looking at coastal, low-lying areas, seawalls have been built in places in Miami, in places in Seattle. Geoengineering, which is a methodology that's being explored largely in some of the northern European countries for actually changing the climate itself by, for example, shooting particular types of material into the air. These sorts of solutions are things we should be pursuing. They're a lot easier to do because technology is a lot easier to do than anything remotely approaching a global carbon tax, which will, number one, be unsuccessful, and two, will not mitigate the effects on the climate nearly as much as you're talking about. Human beings are great at adaptation, and we suck at mitigation. And, as I've said before, and been mocked for it, the simple fact of the matter is, over the course of the next hundred years, when you see all these maps, and it's like, this area will be flooded, and all those people will be dead. No, because they won't be living there. Because as it turns out, when the tide rises, people move inland. This is what has been happening throughout human history. Not a huge number of people were killed, presumably, when the land bridge between Russia and Alaska, from which Sarah Palin could see, right, when that land bridge ended up being covered up in water, there weren't tens of thousands of people who died in that, because it took thousands of years for that to be covered up by water. Slow-moving crises are not crises, they're problems, not emergencies.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

On the same day that 16-year-old Greta Thunberg delivered her impassioned speech to the UN on her claim that there is a climate emergency, a group of 500 qualified scientists and commentators sent the UN Secretary General this registered letter, making it clear that there is no climate emergency. For some reason, despite most major news outlets claiming that they are covering climate now, this has not surfaced as news. That's curious, isn't it? I know that our organization sent the press release to at least 500 media contacts, so maybe it will just reach more people if I just read the message to you. Your Excellencies, there is no climate emergency. A global network of more than 500 knowledgeable and experienced scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have the honor to address Your Excellencies in the attached European Climate Declaration, for which the signatories to this letter are the national ambassadors. The general circulation models of climate on which international policy is at present founded are unfit for their purpose. Therefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models. Current climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting the lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power. We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation. We ask you to place the Declaration on the agenda of your imminent New York session. We also invite you to organize with us a constructive, high-level meeting between world-class scientists on both sides of the climate debate early in 2020. The meeting will give effect to the sound and ancient principle, no less of sound science than of natural justice, that both sides should be fully and fairly heard. Audiator et altera pars. Please let us know your thoughts about such a joint meeting. Yours sincerely, Ambassadors of the European Climate Declaration. So here are the main points that they made. There is no climate emergency. Climate science should be less political. Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming. Warming is far slower than predicted. Climate policy relies on inadequate models. CO2, carbon dioxide, is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth. Global warming has not increased natural disasters. Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities. There is no climate emergency. There is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times and throughout the world. So that is the end of the message sent to the UN by 500 expert scientists and qualified commentators. I sincerely hope this statement will offer young people some peace and comfort. While I respect the desire of so many young people and children to stand up for something, I see that some people are literally frightened into paralyzing anxiety. That's not how children should live their lives. And as you just saw, it doesn't reflect the scientific facts. I hope all of you will research the topic of climate change and see how vast and interesting it is, and not just listen to activists like Greta. I respect Greta too. She's clearly acting out of deep passion and fear. But as these 500 scientists point out, there's nothing to fear. There's no climate emergency. Everyone can go back to school and study science, math, and the stars. We live in a world of wonder. Let's be grateful for our many blessings and all the good we've inherited from generations past. We stand on the shoulders of giants. Let us respect our elders and honour all they have provided us with. For Friends of Science Society, I'm Michelle Sterling.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

The second coming of Christ is not the return of Jesus Christ from the sky. The second coming of Christ is the global catastrophe. This is why Christ says, No stone shall be left unturned before I come back. That means everything's going to be destroyed. Earthquakes in diverse places. That's because the entire mantle is starting to shake up because the whole world's about to go I know you've heard about the auroras and how they're getting farther and farther down the southern hemisphere and you're starting to see more and more colors not just that greenish blue that happens up in the northern hemisphere. That's because the earth's magnetic field is disappearing and one day it's going to go away and the earth is going to get supercharged and we're going to have a global catastrophe. You might have heard about that asteroid child that just passed through the womb of Virgo. If you paid attention for the following weeks many of the stars in the sky were missing. Although I don't know for sure why that happened if we follow Revelation when it says the red dragon will sweep its tail it's probably talking about a planet with an iron oxide tail. That's why you're seeing that weird stuff on the ground all over the place. That's iron oxide. Part of the reason that the aurora is starting to turn red. That gas and that material blocked out a bunch of the stars. When the red dragon sweeps its tail a third of the stars fall from the sky. It was blocking our view from being able to see them. Pretty soon you no matter where you are on the planet are going to start seeing rainbow colors everywhere. You're going to start seeing streaks of hot plasma across the sky. They're going to tell you it's rockets or satellites and all this nonsense. But it's not. You think they're building all those bunkers for World War 3? Think again. They're building those bunkers and they're putting their rocket ships right next to those bunkers because they know the global catastrophe is coming. They're letting you think all these stories about the second coming of the savior so that you don't freak out and cause global catastrophe before it actually happens. The reason they've been trying so hard to take all the pew-pews away is because when this happens and the grid falls and it will, the entire world will fall apart and we'll go back to the laws of the jungle and they prefer that all of us weren't armed along with them. Those FEMA camps, those FEMA camps aren't because they're trying to create a world dictatorship. They know they're not going to be able to do that, at least not right away. They have to get over this big hump of the global catastrophe. You'll notice that some of these camps have barbed wire facing inward like a regular prison but some of them have barbed wire facing outward because they're protecting those people in there. Some of these places are for criminals and others are for just regular civilians that they're actually trying to protect. If you haven't been in this corner of TikTok or YouTube I suggest you start looking into it. Check out Richard Madsen, Demolish Doctrine on YouTube. Check out Ben Davidson of Suspicious Observers. Check out Graham Hancock. He talks about these times back in history where it just looks like the entire world was like it was like a carpet that just got flipped. And I don't know if you're paying attention but there's more volcanoes erupting right now than we've probably ever seen in modern history and the amount of 6.0 and higher earthquakes this year it's breaking every single record. And how about the aurora borealis? This year alone the aurora has made it down to places like Arizona six times. Before that it took 10 years for the aurora to make it down to places like Arizona six times and before that it took a hundred years. Folks, you need to get prepared and the way that you're going to get prepared is by clearing out all of your BS. All the grief, all the trauma, all the anger and restrengthening your bioelectric field. This is going to be your best protection. After that it's finding a decent cave underneath mountains that have their own electromagnetic field from all the metal that's inside of them. You need to pay attention to the right things. You need to be paying attention to nature because nature is the only thing that's not being dishonest with us anymore. This is why the bible tells you pay attention to the signs of the stars, okay? Because the media is going to lie to you, okay? Science is going to lie to you. They're all corrupt. They're just protecting their own self-interest and you need to stop giving yourself away to bad ideologies, philosophies and fantasy stories. It is important that we live our lives like Christ, okay? But it's also important for us to understand what the gospels and Revelation and many other books were trying to tell us, in fact, scream at us. We had to go through a global catastrophe and we want to give you the information you need so that you can survive it the way we did. We were given a glorious gift with the amount of information we were left from our ancient ancestors and we need to stop assuming that they were goofball barbarian cave people who just drew on walls. They had an incredible civilization and they lost much of it to this global catastrophe and then they did everything they could to try to help us in the future so that we could prepare against it.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

It's not a climate weapon. It is a cosmic influence that occurs in our solar system every 12,000 years. And once every 24,000 years, this effect becomes even stronger and more dangerous. And currently, we are in the midst of the most powerful phase of this cycle. The cosmic influence affects the core of our planet and the cores of other planets in the solar system. This energy from the cosmic influence keeps increasing, leading to the heating and the imbalance of the Earth's core. The Earth's core has shifted and become unbalanced, and this has changed everything. The magnetic field, the Earth's crust, the oceans, the glaciers, the volcanoes, and the earthquakes. But it will get even worse. Nuclear volcano eruptions and mega-earthquakes, floods that resemble the biblical flood. We can say this with 100% certainty because exactly the same events occurred in the previous cycles 12 and 24,000 years ago. But today, we have even more challenging conditions. Yes, John, it is very important to understand that previously, even through the worst catastrophes, life has always continued on our planet. And even though many species died out, but the life continued. But this time, because of the format of our society, which does not value environment, does not value human life, it only cares about consumption and money, we did something that has never been done on our planet. We killed the ocean. And right now, that protective mechanism that was supposed to cool down our planet through the peak of this 24,000-year cycle, it's not there anymore. It is the way that we deprived ourselves and our children of the future. It was the final blow, and it was anthropogenic factor. Yes, we, humanity, made a significant impact on the way the things are going right now. We ourselves have put that last nail into the coffin of our own civilization. Because we people, we killed the ocean. Therefore, this cycle, our Earth may perish, alone, with all the people on it.

So it created a negative feedback loop, but it looks like in ice core records that the amount of CO2 goes up as temperature increases. This could be because as the oceans warm up, they're able to hold less CO2, so more CO2 comes out of the oceans into the atmosphere as the Earth warms up. Thankfully, as we get increasing feedback like that, there's other negative feedback cycles that start to come into play, that start to cool us back down again, and usually they compensate so well, they plummet us into the next ice age.

It's such a ridiculous wording that it makes it obvious that they're hiding something. Here's an example. Why are the Atlantic Oceans heating up? Climate change. Okay, so what you're saying, climate scientists, is that when I ask you a question like, why is the climate changing, you say, because of climate change. Notice they haven't set any addendums on what exactly we're supposed to do. Notice that they knew about this stuff a hundred years ago when we were dumping massive amounts of trash in the ocean or we were letting big giant oil companies get bigger and gianter. This was never about some sort of man-made climate change. This was always about a cycle of catastrophe on this planet that happens. We have had ice age spikes. We have had heat spikes over and over and over again throughout the eons. And we are more than due for another one. Except they didn't have man-made climate change 12,000 years ago or 24,000 years ago or 36,000 years ago when all these things happened the same way they're happening now. So what was it? Dinosaur farts? Folks, there's something way bigger happening here. There are destruction cycles on this planet. It might be because of a pole shift. It might be because of Nibiru that there's actually a binary star system that comes through and just wreaks havoc.

It is important to note that according to the ice core data each time during the cycle the CO2 concentration increases due to ocean heating. The same thing is happening now. CO2 is rising indeed but it has nothing to do with human activity nowadays just as it had nothing to do with it in previous times. We're now seeing a critical increase in climate disasters on earth.

And the further back in time the greater this error becomes and it can be thousands of years. However cyclic cataclysms occur exactly every 12,000 years. Facts and dates are very stubborn things. So unfortunately we are forced to state that we are just in for the next such cycle. A 12,000 year cycle of climatic catastrophes which is overlapped by more catastrophic 24,000 year cycle. So unfortunately the worst case scenario awaits us.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

Most of us have never heard of this person because when he made it to the stratosphere he said he saw what appeared to be a flat disk with an upturned edge. Now after Auguste Piccard ventured to the stratosphere, we have the US Air Force showing us the stars from space for the very first time. And when you look at what they showed us, what they actually saw, you begin to understand why the moon landing never had stars in the background, why they're not showing us stars from space anymore, because it's very difficult to pull this off. The sky is indeed black. As you can see the stars, pretty much all the time you can see the stars. The sky of course was black. The heavens are ten times as bright, stars ten times as numerous.

It's an unfathomable blackness, like with a texture you feel like you can stick your hand into. And that's when things start to get weird, because people have gone back and looked at declassified documents that for some reason keep mentioning a flat, non-rotating Earth. Over and over again, it's in their flight plans, it's in all their working models. This flat, stationary Earth repetitively keeps showing up.

It started with reading this article today about Mars spinning faster than it should. NASA had a spacecraft called InSight that was collecting data from Mars and it was tracking solar days and it came to find that every year the day was getting shorter on Mars by four milliseconds not a lot but observable and if the day is shorter that means it's spinning faster. So each year it's been tracked it's been getting faster faster and I thought oh that's really interesting I wonder why that is. They don't really have a good reason for it but there's a few theories. One of the theories has to do with the changing of Mars's polar ice caps so if you didn't know Mars does have polar ice caps just like we do and they change. So the working theory is okay these polar ice caps are changing they are melting therefore the planet is spinning faster. Okay great but wait Earth's polar caps are also changing this is just north and south but obviously I don't need to show you you know that they're getting smaller. Are we spinning faster? Oh my god what the heck Earth is also spinning faster this article came out last year. Now of course the reason why is up for conjecture there's not really a solid theory on it yet some people think it has to do with like the moon's tides however it could also be because of the polar caps. As they melt the planet spins faster. So Mars has been spinning faster for years now Earth has been spinning faster for years now. One thing so far that we've found in common is that the polar ice caps are melting and then I thought hmm I wonder if any of the other planets are spinning faster. Long story short gas planets don't follow the same rules. Venus is kind of a unicorn Venus deserves its own video that place is wild. So that leaves Mercury. Wouldn't you know? Same thing. Now Mercury is really close to the Sun it doesn't have polar ice caps. But it has been observed to be spinning faster. Okay what do they all have in common? Well maybe it's because they all live in space. The universe is getting warmer. So it has now been found that as the universe expands and we have things like gas and nebulous clouds putting off radiation that's heating up the universe. So we need to quickly reconcile that space is both freezing and hot. The vacuum of space the area between different things is frozen no temperature. Areas where things are happening like creation of stars, dying of stars, star nurseries, formation of planets all of these things that's where it gets to be high radiation and heat. So understand that space can be both freezing and hot. So this activity takes place and it comes through space and then hits us in the form of radiation. I don't have a lot of time for the who what when where why how but it's been suspected that there's a link between cosmic radiation and climate change. This is how we understand climate change to take place. We've only ever put a picture of the Sun but maybe we should put in everything else in the galaxy with it. All of the very far away activities that are taking place that are causing the universe to get hotter. Something else that I think is interesting about this is yes we are also causing the climate change by burning fossil fuels and stuff like that which is making our ice caps melt which is making the Earth spin faster but that is not happening on Mars. Nobody is burning fossil fuels on Mars so how are both Earth and Mars polar ice caps melting? There's no people to make climate change there but it's still happening so maybe it's not global warming maybe it's cosmic warming.'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

I'm going to even give you the mic. You get to finish asking your question, but then I'm going to answer it after that. Is that a deal? Okay, great. Yeah, I'm just wondering how can you look your children in the eye while you basically deny that our future is literally on fire and our planet is burning? Thank you. So I'm going to give you some hard facts about, this is an issue I've spent a lot of time on, long before I ran for president. This is near and dear to me. I was probably the leading opponent in the private sector of the ESG movement, the Environmental, Social and Governance movement, which is basically based above all on one thing, the basis that climate change is an existential risk to humanity and we need to stop burning fossil fuels. So let's take a minute on this one and go deeper than we usually would because you've asked it a question. Eight times as many people die of cold temperatures rather than warm ones. Eight times as many people died last year of cold temperatures rather than warm ones. The earth is more covered with green surface area today than it was a century ago because carbon dioxide is plant food. The number of climate disaster related deaths is down by 98% over the last century. The number of people who died of a heat wave, a tornado, a hurricane, any other natural disaster, drought or otherwise, is down by 98%. For every, I remember our deal. We made a deal. I gave you the mic. I'm gonna answer your question, okay? So we had that deal. Fair enough? Because these are important facts. For every 100 people that died in 1920, two people die today of a climate related disaster. So against that backdrop, do I think we need to abandon our modern way of life because of some infinitesimally small increase in global surface temperatures when more people are dying of cold temperatures than warm ones? No, I do not. When the climate disaster related death rate has gone down by 98%, do I think we need to abandon our modern way of life? Abandon fossil fuels? No, I do not. Do I think it justifies a carbon dioxide capture pipeline using eminent domain to being built across this state to seize the land of innocent farmers? No, I do not. And so the answer is this. You oppose all pipelines because you don't think farmers and everyday people should be choking in our air. Air is like not- So I'm gonna answer. I'm answering your question, but it may not be the answer you want, but I'm giving you a hard answer to your question. Here's the truth. And in this one, I'm gonna ask you to open your eyes too, because I think that you might even be on the same side of understanding the hoax here. The biggest opponents to fossil fuels in the United States are also the biggest opponent, are also perfectly fine, by the way, with shifting those same carbon emissions to places like China. Now here's a further mystery. You would think if you're fighting global climate change, those same carbon emissions in China, how does that work? They're over there in China, but we stop them over here. Interesting how that works. Now you go one level deeper. The same people who are most opposed to fossil fuels in the United States are also the biggest opponents to nuclear energy, which is the greatest form of carbon-free energy production known to mankind. This doesn't make sense. I'm not done yet. I'm not, excuse me, I'm not done yet, ma'am, and we're gonna be respectful. I'm gonna finish this, and we're gonna go to the next question. The answer is the climate change agenda has nothing to do with the climate, because if it did, these people would be embracing nuclear energy, and these people would be opposed to China doing what they are. This is about China catching up to the United States of America, and I refuse to flog ourselves wearing a hair shirt for a quasi-religious cult that has caused us to abandon our modern way of life. More people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of climate change itself, and I will not stand for that level of an assault on our modern way of life, so thank you, thank you for your question.

It's just quite amazing that someone that is in government, actually elected to the government of the United States of America, would propose that we eliminate all fossil fuels in 12 years. This would basically result, if we did it on a global level, it would result in the decimation of the human population from 7 odd billion down to who knows how few people. I mean, it would basically begin a process of cannibalization amongst the human species, because the food could not be delivered to the stores in the middle of the cities anymore. How would this, even just that one point, the point that bothers me the most is if you eliminated fossil fuels, every tree in the world would be cut for fuel. There's no other source of heating and cooking once you eliminate fossil fuels. You can use animal dung if there were any animals left, but the animals would all die too because, well, first off, they would all get eaten, and any that survived would have to go wild because there'd be nobody left to look after them.

The latest example of which? This tweet from Greta Thunberg from five years ago that she deleted the other day. She said that we have to stop using fossil fuels in five years, or climate change will wipe out all of humanity. Well, it's been five years, and last time I checked, humanity is still here. But it isn't just Greta Thunberg. These predictions have been made for almost 60 years, and they've always turned out to be wrong. As it turns out, the climate is in fact changing, but the extent to which humans cause it and the extent to which it affects our society is still very much up for debate. And the solution is definitely not to lower the quality of life for millions of people across the planet just to lower the Earth's temperature by half of a degree. So let's go through some of these predictions together. Now before there was a Greta Thunberg or an Al Gore, there was a Dr. Paul Ehrlich. He was the OG climate alarmist. In 1968, he wrote a book called The Population Bomb. And in this book, he predicted that climate change and overpopulation were going to cause millions of people across the world to starve to death in the 1970s. Paul Ehrlich also predicted in 1970 that all of the world's oceans would be dead as Lake Erie in less than a decade. He also predicted that America would be subject to water and food rationing by 1980. Now all of those things obviously ended up not coming true. But even though he has been fully discredited, he made an appearance on 60 Minutes just earlier this year. But it wasn't just Paul Ehrlich in the 1970s, it was also Leonard Nimoy who played Spock in Star Trek. He cut a PSA in 1970 saying that if humanity didn't change their way, a new ice age would soon be upon us. Prominent scientists of the 1970s also predicted that there would be a new ice age by 2000. In 1980, the US government predicted that acid rain would kill all of the wildlife in America's lakes. But 10 years later, they were proven wrong. The United Nations in 1989 predicted that rising seas would obliterate entire nations by 2000. I've been looking to turn my house into a beachfront property and I'm still waiting for that to happen. In 2000, scientists predicted that children now would not know what snow is. It's 2023 and last time I checked, it still snows every winter. In 2002, they predicted that there would be global famine in 10 years. Still waiting for that famine to happen. This brings us to all of their predictions about the Arctic melting. In 2008, NASA said that the Arctic would be ice-free by 2018. John Kerry in 2014 predicted that the Arctic would be ice-free by 2019. And Al Gore predicted in 2009 that the Arctic would be ice-free by 2014. Speaking of our friend Al Gore, he also predicted in 2006 that quote, unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases are taken within the next 10 years, the world will reach a point of no return. Well, it's been a couple years since 2016 and I'm still waiting for this point of no return. Speaking of that washed up fossil Al Gore, he still goes out there to make catastrophic predictions about the climate. He went to the World Economic Forum earlier this year and said that we're boiling the oceans, creating rainbombs, sucking moisture out of the land, creating droughts and melting the ice. He's super serial guys. But if you think I'm done yet, there's more. In 2009, Prince Charles said that we have just 96 months to save the world.

Can you give us an introduction? Yeah, again, the term geoengineering, aka chemtrails, the layman's term for what we see happening in the skies, but this is weather modification on a global scale. In fact, these programs are so large and so all-encompassing that all other weather modification programs that go on on a smaller regional basis are virtually, they're negated by the scope and scale of the global geoengineering programs. And these programs involve a number of aspects. You have the saturation of the atmosphere with various chemical and metal particulates, and there appear to be various purposes and objectives with this saturation. In conjunction with the saturation, which ionizes the atmosphere, makes the atmosphere more conductive, we have the HAARP facilities, high-frequency active auroral research program. These are ionosphere heaters. Many have heard of the HAARP facilities. There's not just one or two or three. We believe there's at least 18 around the globe, possibly with three more being built in Antarctica right now. And once the atmosphere is saturated with these particulates, and then you add the ionosphere heaters, the entire weather system globally is virtually being thwarted. There is no natural weather at this point, and we really don't know what sort of climate conditions we would have necessarily if these programs were brought to a halt, and they desperately need to be brought to a halt, because the saturation of the atmosphere is thwarting the hydrological cycle. It's totally disrupting the rain cycle. Again, we have the artificially nucleated snowstorms, which I just mentioned. You can't go from 100 degrees to snow in one day without a whole lot of help. This includes jet stream manipulation with the HAARP facilities, and we are not guessing at this. We have monitoring sources for this signal, and we can see where the signal is most intense, and that's what steers the jet stream. So then you add artificial ice nucleation, which is a chemical nucleation process. They can turn what should have been rain into snow and drop the temperatures of these storm systems by this artificial chemical nucleation. This isn't sci-fi. This is hard science fact. The weather disseminating agencies are trying desperately. Their task, and they're all owned at the very top, it appears, by the Rothschilds and for other parts of the global elite complex. Rothschilds, in particular, are ownership of Weather Channel, Weather Central, Weather Underground, and it was imperative that they own these agencies. Otherwise, there would be great discrepancy in trying to explain away these events. Transcribed by https://otter.ai'''\n        ", "completion": "10"}

This dry summer has marked an especially dire one for environmentalists. Passing hurricanes and storms are only adding to the heat, average temperatures are rising, and the highest day in human history was recorded just last month. However, the situation in Maui, Hawaii is looking even worse than in the rest of the country. Right now, the firestorms in Maui have turned the land into a war zone. Burned-out cars have been crushed by fallen telephone poles. Blackened elevator shafts stand like reminders of the apartment buildings that were once there. Dangerous puddles litter the ground, filled with dark, acidic water. Trampolines and kids' scooters have even been twisted out of shape by the superhot flames. Folks from Lahaina could finally return home on Friday, the first time since the wildfires began, which sadly took the lives of at least 55 people, transforming big parts of their old town into a grim landscape of gray ruins. Reporters from various news outlets have all seen and reported on the destruction, with no positive news coming to light. The Hawaii roosters that usually strut around the streets are now wandering through the remains, including a spooky lineup of burnt-car wrecks that couldn't escape the raging fire, and now even animals are being pulled into the casualties of climate change as nests, farmland, and all safe zones have been burnt beyond repair. It happened so fast, it was unbelievable, shared Lahaina resident Kyle Scharnhorst, looking at the damage to his apartment complex in the morning. It felt like a battlefield. He is not the first or the last person to describe what remains of Maui, Hawaii as a wasteland. In fact, climate change has now started to affect tourism in Hawaii, devastating the local economy and a sharp warning for what might happen to the rest of the world if climate activists, environmentalists, and global leaders don't come together to resolve the issue.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

So today we're up here at 420 parts per million. This is the last 800,000 years from deep ice cores in Antarctica of CO2. So from 150 parts per million to 420 parts per million. If we look at the observational record that we've been taking since the late 1950s, here's what it looks like. We have this continued increase from the late 50s to the 2022. And if we look closer at this one week, there's a lot of variability in CO2 as winds blow around across Hawaii, where this record is from. They take daily averages. Here's a month, still a little noisy. Six months, you see this pattern start to emerge. One year, you see that in the Northern Hemisphere, summer, you actually, sorry, the spring, you have a peak in CO2 concentrations, and as trees really start to bloom in the Northern Hemisphere and start to really do their photosynthesis, they take up CO2 down to a minimum in September, October, and that happens every year. So there's two years of the cycle, and again, the full record. If you need to see further back in time, you have to use ice cores. So here's a record from the year 1700 to today, with those observations from Mauna Loa here, and then ice core observations from Antarctica here from a site called Law Dome that I share a lot about. If you think CO2 may have risen sometime before the 1700s, here's the last 10,000 years. So this is the relatively stable climate. Temperature was much the same, slightly decreasing over this time. Human civilization really developed in the last 10,000 years because of this stable CO2 level, stable climate. If you need to see further back than that, there's a lot of structure, but the biggest feature that you see is that our emissions today rapidly have increased to 420 parts per million in the last 150 years at a rate that's not seen at all in the last 800,000 years. So this is the 800,000 year ice core record from Antarctica. This is data from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The Keeling Curve is this iconic climate record.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

And it's happening all over the world. No progress, they've even gone backwards. Have you heard of the AMOC? The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation? Basically it's the air conditioner of the world. It takes all of the heat from the equatorial region and dumps it in the Arctic Ocean. If the global temperature gets too high, the system collapses, and we've known for a while it's at its weakest point in thousands of years, but there's been signs that it is about to collapse. And finally, we have a new study showing it could collapse as early as 2025. If you've ever seen a movie, The Day After Tomorrow, that's what this is. It's one thing that happens very suddenly and causes an extreme change in global temperatures and climate very quickly. Let's listen to a brief technical explanation of what we can expect from Steve Keen. Well, the most extreme form of climate change would be a breakdown in the three circulation cells that exist in each hemisphere. The Hadley cell, the Ferrer cell, I think it's called, and the polar cells, 0 to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 90. Those are the main bubbles, if you like, in the atmosphere. So when you look at what are called global climate models produced by scientists, one of the examples, and it was published by the OECD last year, 2021, in the chapter on what would happen if we lose what's called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC, and people would colloquially know that as the Gulf Stream. And that's what distributes heat around all the oceans of the planet. It's part of a huge chain called the thermohaline circulation. But the part that goes across from the equator to the North Atlantic, that's called the AMOC and Gulf Stream for a colloquial way. If that disappears in the context of a two and a half degree Celsius increase in average global temperature, then the proportion of the Earth's surface, which is suitable for producing wheat, will fall from 20% to 7%. Proportion for corn, similar sort of fall. The proportion suitable for rice will go from 2% to 3%. Now that means a catastrophic, and that's the word used in the report, catastrophic collapse in food production. Why is this happening now? It's because the place in that graph where, if you look at the top, the AMOC is dumping heat in the North Atlantic Ocean. The salinity of the water has changed so much and the temperature of the water has changed so much that it's no longer doing that. The heat is no longer dropping down there to the bottom of the ocean like it normally does. And this is a huge change very suddenly and it leads the researchers again to conclude that within a couple of years, we could see the whole system collapse and we would see a catastrophic collapse in food production everywhere in the world almost overnight. Should you be worried? Yes. Should you freak out and panic? No. You have a couple of years, right? Start growing your own food. Buy lands with your friends and plant gardens and build networks of permaculture and mutual aid. Time is running out. That doesn't mean we should panic. That doesn't mean we should despair. It means we should try really hard to get ready because this is right around the corner.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

Otherwise, travelers would be falling off the edge all the time. Right? Wrong. If the Earth was not a ball shape, but was instead a flat disk, like this plate, well, with the right density and thickness, living in the middle could feel pretty normal. But as you moved toward the edge, gravity on a disk Earth would slightly skew, pushing at a greater and greater angle back toward the center. My friend Nick from Yeti Dynamics put together this great simulation. The person and buildings obviously aren't to scale, but check out how such increasingly diagonal gravity would work. Although this is a flat disk, it would feel, to a runner headed toward the edge, like they were fighting to climb up a steeper and steeper hill. The building foundations behind the runner reflect how you would have to build structures closer and closer to the edge so that people living in them always felt like down was at right angles to the floor, the way we feel it on our big round Earth. Now, as you approach the edge, things would get scary. Remember, this is a flat Earth, but it would feel like a sheer drop-off. What's really cool is that contrary to the don't fall off the edge fear, on a flat world, because of gravity, the scary risk would actually be falling away from the edge and rolling all the way back to the center. Once you stepped over the edge, instead of falling off into space, you'd be able to relax. It would be a nice, level place. This model, of course, neglects the fact that such a planet shape would be impossible. Anything as massive as the Earth, shaped like a flat disk, would, under its own gravity, naturally collapse back into a ball.

And of course, their existence is going to be limited by the amount of fossils, by the amount of decaying organic material. Not so. So if that's not so, then we need to rethink a lot of things. A lot. I think this one fit into a paradigm by a famous economist that I like very much. His name is Simon. Do you know about this guy named Simon? Julian Simon. Julian Simon, yeah. The key guy. You see of Illinois and then Maryland. He was the guy who said that the ultimate resource of humanity or earth is actually not all this material thing like uranium gold. Because uranium, there are far more uranium in the oceans than on the land, right? You have 4.5 billion tons of uranium in the ocean. You have only 17 million tons of gold, copper. What do you want on the ocean? It's all there, except they're in very dilute form, clearly. So the ultimate resource actually is not that, it's the human mind. It's the innovation part of it. I think I like that principle a lot. And it fits very well in terms of saying that it's all matter of course, even oil. Most, I don't know if any of you know, the audience know that 50 to 60% of the oil, actually all the oil that you already drilled, the drill hole, you can only pull out 40 to 50% of it. 60% of that remains in it. Because simply because there's not enough pressure to get it out. This is why the idea of abiogenic oil is interesting. It's true, clearly true. It's all matter of course, really. Because this thing has to form way inside the earth, the mantle, which is 50 to 100 miles, right? Human, how deep have we ever drilled? Only the skin, which is only five miles maximum, five to six miles basically. That's at most that we can drill. And then all this stuff has to permeate into the reservoir. I got this information from the top. People that physically have to look for oil every day. One of my friends, Joseph Lime Cooler from Beacon Energy, offshore energy. Those are the guys who work day in and day out to bring us the energy actually, the oil that we need. So why don't most people know this? Why do most people think that the gasoline in their car was by definition- Have to be limited, yeah. Yeah, that there's just a tiny amount and it's going away. We'll never find more. The world is full of untruth and half truth, right? That's the whole problem, right? That's why for so long, even the idea that we're not limited and bounded by availability of let's say gasoline, petroleum or coal. Coal now they won't allow us to use, right? As you know, in COP meeting in Dubai that just ended a day ago, they just physically declared themselves that we should stop using fossil fuel. Basically petroleum, natural gas and even coal. I mean, these people are insane now, really insane. I think they're gonna harm more people with their own delusion. Plus they always remember, these are people who actually don't represent the majority.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

Scientists in Korea claim to have successfully created a room temperature ambient pressure superconductor which could revolutionize industries including computing, transport, power and healthcare. If this experiment can be recreated at scale, it could lead to the invention of flying cars, energy shields, space elevators or even invisibility cloaks. There are still huge questions as to the validity of this research, but if realized, what could this mean for our lives in the future? In 2021, superconductor cables were installed in northern Illinois, conducting electricity approximately 200 times more efficiently than a comparable copper cable. A superconductor is a material that has zero electrical resistance, which means it doesn't waste energy or heat. To understand this, think of electricity as a flowing river of electrons. In regular conductors, like the wires we use in our homes, there is always some resistance to the flow of electrons, which results in energy loss and heat generation. In a superconductor, electrons form special partnerships known as Cooper Pairs. These Cooper Pairs move in perfect synchronization through the material without scattering or collisions. What's fascinating is that these electrons also exhibit wave-like behavior in addition to their particle-like nature. This wave-like behavior allows them to move in perfect harmony, creating a seamless and synchronized flow of electricity. This synchronized movement of the electrons is what we call quantum coherence. Because there is no resistance in superconductors, the Cooper Pairs can carry electric currents without any energy loss. This property is what makes superconductors so remarkable and valuable. Until now, superconductivity was only observed at very low temperatures, around minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit, requiring expensive and complex cooling systems. The potential introduction of LK99 changes everything by enabling superconductivity at room temperature, eliminating the need for these extreme cooling methods. Current estimates suggest that 10% of the global energy supply is lost in transfer, which would save $20 billion per year in the US alone. In transportation, maglev trains could double in speed to 1,000 miles per hour, MRI machines could produce images 100 times sharper than today, and computers could be 1,000 times faster than they are now. This is only the beginning. The development of room-temperature superconductors is a major scientific challenge, and this latest development is still highly questionable, but if this discovery is recognized, the potential benefits are unfathomable. If successful, this technology will revolutionize our lives, making the world a cleaner, safer, and more equitable place. Now is the time to wait and see what comes next.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

A lot of y'all are throwing the baby out with the bathwater when you naturally rebel against eco-fascism and then you get rid of environmentalism. That ain't what to do. Let's start with the environment, specifically global warming. A lot of people think that the issue is that the world is getting hotter because of human caused climate change and other people be like, no, that's a lie. The sun was going to do whatever and we was going to get hotter regardless. That's not the problem. The issue was that if the world don't get no hotter, we are in the age of the sixth mass extinction. If the world don't get no hotter, we've got a plastic problem in the ocean. If the world don't get no hotter, we got issues with pollution and the poisons of our environment getting into our bodies. The eco-fascists will look at the problems with pollution and implement control measures over the economy and over people and over governments that don't do anything but enrich themselves and increase measures of control without solving the actual problem. Eco-fascists who will not be named have convinced a lot of us that the way to solve the environment problem is to actually just get rid of the people. In fact, we need more hands on deck to solve the problem. You see, the issue is that the planet cannot handle 10 billion consumers, but the world actually needs billions of stewards. And the population ain't booming everywhere. There are places that have negative population growth. Way more people are dying than being born and they got a whole different set of problems. And this is going to balance out the growth of the world.

We need people to create a circle economies and ocean pasture restoration and certain animal wildlife conservation efforts. We need all of that. People are rescuing mangroves.

People were terrified as Antarctica started to grow terrifying plants which will mark a dangerous, deadly end for animals and the rest of us. The plants signify the rate in which the ice caps are melting, which allows plants to grow and thrive, which should never be happening. Scientists have even issued a warning to say that this will trigger some very scary changes for our planet. These plants were initially said to be rarely found in Antarctica, but as the temperatures have grown warmer, they've begun to spread and even mutate, causing the plants and ice to introduce to the world new viruses and new diseases. And according to scientists, the speed in which these flowers are growing and spreading have accelerated 3x since 1960. The flowers also serve as a reminder that the weather is in fact getting much warmer, and could cause permanent damage to penguins and polar bears. But for now, I guess it's cool that penguins will have flowers to give to their partners.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

I think you know it's good to have a light moment in your speech as well but the point is actually, they're not proposing a meat tax. The point is actually very serious. So some of the things that Labour are proposing are incredibly hard for working families so whether you have, whether you have things like... What's meat tax? That's what you're saying here. So the point is they are proposing things which are pushing families too hard. So you've got things like the EULA's tax expansion which does cost families \u00a312.50 a day but that is very difficult and they've got things like proposing that you would decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030 again which would result in very difficult choices for families and their plans to push up inflation by borrowing \u00a328 billion. So the point that I was making is quite serious. Yes that was a light-hearted moment in the speech but the point is actually deadly serious that if you push people too far in this country you will lose the cause of climate change. Something that I'm passionate about because I think it's really important that we get there. But genuinely there isn't a meat tax. Well actually if you try and push too hard what you do end up with is people, and by the way this has been part of the debate, talking about discouraging people from eating meat. Now someone who's worked in government for some time I can tell you when people tell you that they want to discourage people from eating meat what they mean is a tax. So when they talk about moving at the pace that they're moving what they're implying is that difficult choices will have to be made and we know from having carefully safeguarded this debate that when people talk about trying to do things faster and quicker they do talk about things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things that things'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

I believe with all of my heart and soul that God gives his goofiest battles to his silliest little geese. And that's me. That's who I am as a person. Not only is the North Pole home to the most exceedingly high mountain in the world, Mount Zion, the mountain of God. The Bible says Zion is in Jerusalem. It never gives another location for another Mount Zion. It is also home to Paradise, the Garden of Eden, which is still here to this day. If you're not aware, the further north you go, the colder it gets. Now I know we white people like the snow and all, but I can promise you, the North Pole is not where Paradise is. Now prepare for a big awakening. Oh yeah folks, you want to be prepared for this one. This is one of the first ever maps created of the North Pole in the 1500s. I want you to focus on the middle here. You have a mountain with a river coming out of it, and then you have four rivers coming out of that river in the middle. No, this map shows a lake with four rivers coming out of it. This map was made by Gerhard Mckater. He never went to the North Pole, nor did he do a lot of traveling. His map was based on accounts from travelers, conjectures, and speculation. And it should be obvious to anyone that he made a bunch of errors, like including the mythical island of Frisland. So why would you assume he got the North Pole right? That mountain in the middle, it is called the Rupes Nigra. Sir, it is 2023. We do not say that word anymore. Straight from Wikipedia, Rupes Nigra means black rock. Rupes Nigra is a black rock magnetic mountain located at the North Pole. No, it was a phantom island that was hypothesized to be there to explain why all compasses pointed north. But now we know why compasses point north, and we have no evidence the island is there, nor do we need it to explain compasses. Funny how the biggest investment company in the world is Black Rock. Black Rock is connected to the North Pole? So that's how Santa gets all his money for the presents. In reality, Black Rock was an offshoot of a company called Blackstone, and the name for that came from the two founders, Schwarz, which is German for black, and the word Peter comes from the Greek word for stone. So soon after this map came out, the map started looking like this. Unknown region, what is that? Because this is a map from 1901, and at that point there was still not a lot known about the North Pole. But now we have modern satellite imaging, and we can see there is no Black Mountain or Garden of Eden at the North Pole. Here's your NASA satellite footage, just a couple of big black holes in the center. Because these were sun-synchronous operational meteorological satellites from the 60s. It measured reflected solar and longwave radiation leaving the Earth. If the sun was not hitting the North or South Pole at that point, you wouldn't get anything. Oh, nothing to see here. This image is not looking at the surface, it's looking at noctilucent clouds to study atmospheric winds. If you look at it in motion, you can clearly see landmasses and oceans beneath the clouds. So here I am in Psalm 48, look what it says here, the city of our God and the mountain of his holiness. Yeah, that's referring to Jerusalem, because there's no city at the North Pole. Unless they found the workshop of... Satan! Oh my God! On the sides of the North. So this mountain is the joy of the whole Earth and it is in the North. The word there for North is Zephan, which was a mountain often associated with divinity. Robert Alter notes the psalmist is talking about Jerusalem in cosmic terms. He's not saying Mount Zion was actually at the North Pole. The beautiful fourth situation, the biblical usage is elevation, height. This is an exceedingly high mountain. It's not the Mount Zion, which is in Jerusalem. Yes, it is. He uses cosmic terminology to speak of the glory of Zion. Remember, the Psalms are poetic. You can't take everything they say literally. And the devil taking him up into a high mountain, he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. Where did he take him? He took him to the exceedingly high mountain in the middle of our Earth, in the North Pole. What? If Jesus could see all the kingdoms of the world from a 33 mile wide black mountain at the North Pole, then we should all be able to see this black mountain, right? After all, if Jesus could see where we're at, we should be able to see this mountain point. That's how line of sight works. This is a live view of the wind finder at the North Pole. What is that big old thing there blocking the wind? Yeah, I have no clue what you've zoomed in on. I went to this site and you can go all the way into the North Pole and everything looks fine. There's no mountain there. So to wrap up yet another goofy battle, there is no evidence the Garden of Eden or a black mountain is at the North Pole.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

The IPCC, or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is run at the UN, released a report today that was pretty terrifying, to say the least. Basically, they said if we somehow cut our emissions in half in the next seven years, less than a decade to pollute half as much as we're currently polluting, we can minimize the damage to not much worse than it is now. However, we're not going down in emissions. We're going up in emissions. We're actually emitting much, much more every year. And as the report says, even the most optimistic among us believe that that train has already left the station. Basically, the report says, without radical, massive action, in 10 to 15 years, climate change is gonna become completely unfixable and things are going to just implode, basically. It's gonna be bad. So yeah, that's scary. That's scary. This was a real doom and gloom one. They talk about really the crash that we would notice most is our agricultural system getting disrupted. And they're saying sometime in the 2030s, it's likely that the agricultural system would get disrupted to the point where first world food prices are much worse than the inflation that we see today. So hopefully somebody somewhere takes this to heart and does something about it. Probably not. Probably about half the people watching think that climate change is nonsense. So I'm kind of in that doom and gloom, but I really don't think there's much to be done about this.

Aside from polar bears, penguins, and seals potentially going extinct, flowers growing in Antarctica are a sign that the climate is warming, thus leading to sea levels rising that would cause the ocean to cover most coastal cities including New York and Los Angeles.

And this one is completely inexcusable and reeks of rank hypocrisy. Because this was a show that would have been approved long before it was filmed and would have required some planning. In its wisdom, the BBC, commonly referred to as ANTI, put together a panorama episode about climate change and the damage that we as humans are doing to the planet, entitled Why Are We Still Searching for Fossil Fuels? In order to do this, they felt that they should send their reporter, and I'm presuming a crew, on an estimated 20,000 mile jaunt in airplanes around the world to explain why, in his words, despite all the green promises, we're using more fossil fuels than ever before. Richard Bilton, the programme's reporter, whilst claiming that the world is saying one thing and doing another, travelled to Europe, the Middle East and the United States for the episode. The flights alone producing a conservative estimate of around 5.4 tonnes of CO2, more than the average a person creates in a year and equates to driving a car for 18 months. This reminds me of Harry and Meghan preaching their climate claptrap after having taken a load of private jets, which they are still taking, by the way. Now, I just want to caveat this with the fact that I do think that there is a place for the BBC, but you can't go out of your way to preach by doing the very thing which is causing the problem to find out how it can be solved. Conservative MP Dame Andrea Jenkins said, if the BBC feels it necessary to lecture the public about fossil fuels, they should practice what they preach first. She went on to say, to add to the rank hypocrisy, the BBC could easily have used local teams of reporters in each country, rather than sending one man on a jolly. Apparently, all the flights were economy, but that's okay then. A spokesperson for the BBC said, as a flagship current affairs programme, on occasion, some international travel is required to further investigate important stories and provide audiences with additional insight and analysis, which may not be possible with on-the-ground reporting.

I know the earth is flat. Seriously? Astrology and flat earth or true earth are symbiotic. You cannot have one without the other. If you have a ball and you are spinning, flying through space, chasing this fireball, your constellations would change every now and then. And our constellations have never changed. If that was the case, Polaris would move, number one, which is the north star, and it doesn't. Number two, all the constellations would not rotate solely around Polaris, but they do. Therefore, we are the center of the universe. Well, actually, Polaris is moving and has moved, so he's just factually wrong here. So let me introduce you to the concept of the precession of the equinoxes. This was the third motion of the earth that was discovered by astronomers. In fact, it was first suspected by Hipparchus in around 129 BCE. So at that time, Hipparchus was looking at star charts from 5,000 years earlier, Babylonian star charts, and said, huh, these star charts are off. All of the positions of the stars, not just the constellations, but all the star positions are all shifted. They're significantly shifted, and they were all shifted together. So he correctly deduced from that that, well, that must be because the earth is moving, because everything is shifting in the same way in the sky. And so what is happening is called precession. Have you ever spun a top, and the top, as it's spinning, it rotates around this way? The earth is doing the same thing because of the gravitational influence, mainly of the sun and the moon. As the earth is rotating around its axis, it's also spinning. The axis is shifting this way. And one full circuit takes over 25,000 years to complete. So obviously, that's very slow. But 5,000 years was enough for Hipparchus to note that the axis moved from here to here, and so all the constellations have shifted. Since then, a couple of thousand years have gone by, and it's shifted still further, and we could measure the movement, even though it's very, very tiny year to year, like point, I think it's 0.054 arc seconds. We're talking a very, very tiny amount. But yes, we can measure these very tiny precession of the earth's axis. Polaris wasn't always where the axis of the earth, the North Pole, was not pointing at Polaris. It's roughly not exactly at Polaris, but Polaris is close to that point in the sky, the North Star. It wasn't always that way. It'll drift off, and then 25,000 years in the future, it'll come back again. So he actually refutes his own point. He's just ignorant of astronomy. The constellations are shifting. Now, the constellations are not changing themselves over several thousand years. That kind of movement takes more like hundreds of thousands or millions of years before those changes will happen. But they'll change also. The constellations will change. That's because of the movements of the stars themselves in our revolution around the galaxy. Some stars are moving in different directions at different velocities, so the relative positions will shift. And if you could look at the sky for millions of years, you would see the stars all moving in different directions. Carl Sagan in the original Cosmos series showed some animations of projecting star positions back in the past and forward into the future, if you're interested in that. So yeah, the stars move. The constellations shift. It's because the earth is a sphere revolving around the sun. The other planets are also revolving around the sun. This explains very precisely, incredibly precisely, the movement of the planets in the sky, the shifting with the seasons, all of the movements that we can perceive. We've been measuring these things with increasing precision over the last few thousand years. And no, the earth is not flat.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

I teach science on the internet. My whole career is providing answers to this exact question. So let's go through a few. Evolution is real. And it's obvious. Masks, when properly worn, significantly reduce the spread of respiratory diseases, which is why doctors, and nurses, and dentists, and hygienists, and surgeons, and biologists, and all sorts of other people wear them all the time, and you want them to. Our understanding of the universe does change from time to time. And that's a very, very good thing. Because without that, we would just be believing the same nonsense that we believed thousands and thousands of years ago. Which is why it's always better to be willing to change your mind when presented with good evidence, rather than just digging in your heels and deciding that you're always right. Climate change is the most dire existential threat currently facing humanity, and we need to take care of it while it's still an option to do so. Although race is a completely social construct that, in fact, has no bearing in biological Racism is a very real and very persistent problem that permeates our government at all levels and needs to be taken a lot more seriously than it is. Sex, gender, and sexual orientation are three completely different things, not one of which is a binary, but all three of which are far more diverse, and vibrant, and interesting than the outdated, reductionist, parochial, puritanical, Eurocentric framework that we were all taught in middle school can possibly account for. Vaccines work, and they save lives. Which is why America has a history of vaccine mandates going back into the 1800s. Why I had to get several vaccines in order to attend public school. Why you have to get specific vaccines to qualify for a visa to travel to certain countries. Why several different jobs require specific vaccines in order to keep employees and the people that they're working with safe. Why soldiers have to take dozens of vaccines in order to complete training. And most importantly of all, why you don't have smallpox right now. Scientists know more about science than senators. And last but not least, while of course every scientist is not a good scientist, and everybody gets things wrong sometimes, if you dismiss what the majority of scientists are saying as just pushing an agenda, you don't actually care about science. You just care about feeling like you're right in spite of all the evidence. And that's really dangerous.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

A Nevada ranger plowed his truck through a group of climate change protesters blocking a major road. The insane part is that they caused a massive traffic jam stretching for miles on end. The protest was on Indian tribal land and so the tribal police responded and they do not mess around. After bravely driving straight through their blockade, the ranger exits his car and arrests the female protester while shouting at her to stop resisting. One protester shouts at his friend asking who has the gun, which is a surefire way to get yourself shot by a ranger. Luckily his friend responded that no one has any weapons and they were peaceful protesters. A woman chained herself to the road and was unable to move out of the way for the ranger. Protesters can be seen on video screaming and crying at the police. Other people however cheered for the rangers from their cars. The most ironic part is that their protest caused massive amounts of cars to idle, which is not good for the environment.

This will not go well. Were there dinosaurs and planktons in forests at one point on one of Saturn's moons? Tucker, you absolute toaster. Probably not. So if all hydrocarbons aren't from fossils, where are they from? This is a surprisingly good question from the world's second richest disappointment. First, a history lesson. The term fossil and fossil fuels originally meant simply found buried in the Earth. It was only later that it began to be associated with long-dead organisms. Second, there's lots of hydrocarbons all over the solar system, especially the simplest hydrocarbon, methane. Now, there's not a lot of methane in the inner solar system. It's believed that the primary reason for this is that methane is unstable in the presence of UV radiation, and the closer to the sun a planet is, the more UV it's exposed to. Of course, Earth is an exception. Life tends to produce lots of methane. One of the simplest biological reactions that does this is an example of anaerobic respiration, in which microorganisms produce energy by converting carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen into methane and water. So Earth has a continually replenishing source of methane, at least to a certain extent. Elsewhere in the solar system, it's less clear. One possible abiotic method of production is called serpentinization. It's a rather complex chemical process involving a mineral called olivine interacting with water and CO2 at high temperatures and pressures. The end result is methane and other hydrocarbons, serpentine and magnetite. The conditions required suggests that this would occur deep under a planet's or moon's surface protected from its star's UV radiation. Titan is in such a way that it's very cold, by the way. So it's minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes. Hint, hint, hint. Where's the global warming there, right? This guy is supposed to be an astrophysicist, but apparently doesn't know how to check his facts before he does his propaganda piece. So I'll do it for you. Titan does have a greenhouse effect. It also has an anti-greenhouse effect. Without either of these, the thermodynamically stable temperature would be something like 82 Kelvin. However, Titan has lots of gases in its atmosphere that absorbs strongly in the infrared. Note that the infrared light that Titan emits is much longer wavelength than Earth does because it's much colder. Nonetheless, the presence of hydrogen and methane in the atmosphere means that, absent other factors, Titan would be 21 degrees warmer than it should be based on its distance from the sun. On the other hand, Titan also has an anti-greenhouse effect because of its high-altitude haze that absorbs solar radiation but is mostly transparent to infrared, thereby letting infrared radiation escape and preventing some of the solar radiation from getting in. The effect of this haze would result in a decrease of the temperature of Titan by 9 degrees. The net result is that Titan is about 12 degrees warmer than would be expected. So yes, there's global warming on Titan. You're giving astrophysics a bad name.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

This photo in and of itself is some pretty awesome proof. I've explained this before, but for all the people that didn't see that video, because I'm so shadowbanned, if you go from the west coast to the east coast, flying with the spin of the Earth supposedly, because the Earth is supposedly spinning 1,000 miles per hour eastward, the flight should be longer, right? Going with the spin of the Earth. And then vice versa, if you're going east to west, you're going against the spin of the Earth, it should be shorter. The time? Only 40 minutes. That and the fact that planes use a model called FEM, Flat Earth Model, it should tell you that the Earth might be flat and stationary. And if you want more proof that we are stationary and the atmosphere, ether, medium, whatever is encompassing us is the only thing that's moving. You just have to look at how wind works. So, warm air rises and it cools. So it creates movement. So that's basically how wind works. Again, the molecules from the heat of the sun rises the pressure of the air and then they equalize and move around and switch around. That creates wind, essentially. So you'd have to agree that the molecules of the air rising, equalizing, moving, the wind, creating the wind is part of the atmosphere, right? And one of the first questions I asked when I first found flat Earth is, the Earth is spinning a thousand miles per hour eastward. Why don't we spin under the clouds? And the heliosexuals fired back with that the gravity of the Earth is holding all of the atmosphere and the clouds and all of the molecules in the atmosphere, clouds, medium, ether, whatever you want to call it, with the perfect spin of the Earth. Gravity is pulling it perfectly with it. So you got to realize it. You really want to drive this one home. The Earth is supposedly holding all of this atmosphere, this air, perfectly. While at the same time, satellites can geocentrically, geostationarily, and polarily orbit, supposedly. And the gravity supposedly doesn't keep pulling it in. It just leaves it out there. It doesn't pull it any closer to the... We're not talking about that, though. All that I'm trying to get at here is that if the Earth's gravitational pull is holding all of the atmosphere, all of the molecules, everything in all of these, these layers of the atmosphere, what happened to these molecules? Why aren't these molecules being held with the thousand-mile-per-hour spin of the Earth? You already know what I think. The Earth's flat, and the atmosphere's moving. Not us.

The Los Angeles Police Department is literally policing only the Black Lives Matter side, end quote. What do you mean by that? This is still off topic. No, it's not. You're here as an expert advising us, and I'm asking you about your background. I'm here as an athlete to talk about the effects of climate change on my sport. OK, let's go back. Well, I'm almost out of time. You're well out of time and we have other senators waiting. So please wrap up when you have a moment. All right. Thank you all for your testimony. And that, my friends, is the best expert that the Democrats could come up with to push the climate change agenda. I feel like Senator Kennedy was far too kind to this young man and let him off the hook easily. Let me know what you think in the comments and what you think about the Democrats climate change expert. If you enjoyed the video, be sure to follow.

This operation is bound to have devastating effects on our environment by massively increasing climate change. Big oil company ConocoPhillips plans on pumping over 180,000 barrels of oil every day for the next 30 years out of Alaska. It's estimated that nearly 280 million tons of greenhouse gases will be released. This will be especially disastrous for the indigenous communities of Alaska and the wildlife in the Arctic, but overall it's bad news for the entire planet.

It's called hydrologic sorting you engineers ought to know about that I predict based on the Bible teaching of the flood that there will be billions of fossils Including coal and oil found in those layers of sedimentary rock that we find all over the earth I predict there'll be huge canyons and deltas showing evidence of rapid a massive erosion I predict there'll be legends of this worldwide flood found in cultures all over the world That's a prediction based on the biblical view biblical view of creation is certainly scientific it makes predictions I predict there'll be petrified trees in the vertical position extending through all of these layers Thousands and thousands of these trees have been found around the world petrified standing up Connecting layers that some people want you to believe are different ages I don't know how long a dead tree stands up around here before it falls down But I've been Pensacola you get maybe five or ten years maximum before the tree falls over now Somebody wants you to believe the layers are different ages by millions of years Well, they're welcome to teach you whatever they want, but this is simply not in accordance with the evidence I believe the Bible would predict we would find things like this poly straight fossils a worldwide flood would do that now science means Knowledge a more expanded definition of science means knowledge gained by observation and study and testing My contention is there is absolutely nothing Scientific about the evolution theory if we define what we mean by evolution carefully, which I want to do in my last few minutes here I like science. I taught high school science for 15 years. I love the study study of science. I am NOT against science But I'm against using lies to support a theory And I'm certainly against telling people that science can go farther than it really can the textbook says we have evidence of evolution Okay, what kind of evidence do they give this guy says evolution is fact not theory Birds arose from non birds and humans from non-humans no person who pretends any understanding of the natural world can deny these facts Well, it's okay to make a statement like that But that's just a mantra that doesn't make it true because he states that even if he states it loudly and forcefully It doesn't make it true. Okay, the word evolution has six different meanings. First of all, they would have to be cosmic evolution That would be the origin of time-space matter They try to answer that with the Big Bang Theory with which there are numerous problems Number one the second meaning or level or stage of the evolution theory would have to be chemical evolution If the Big Bang produced hydrogen, well, then how did we get all these other elements? They want me to believe that uranium evolved from hydrogen. That's all you get fusion in stars Well first place you can't fuse past iron number one And secondly if you want the stars to produce the elements you have a chicken and an egg problem here Which came first the elements to make the stars or the stars to make the elements you have a real problem They never talk about chemical evolution I'd like to hear that answer tonight thirdly would have to have stellar evolution the stars would have to evolve Nobody's ever proven the formation of any one star I see a few some few spots getting brighter and they're assuming a star is forming now It could be the dust is clearing. It could be a supernova taking place. There's there's all kinds of explanations Nobody's ever proven a star can form. How do the stars evolve? Fourthly? We have to have organic evolution the origin of life How did life get started? Fifthly is macro evolution where an animal changes to a different kind of animal? Nobody's ever seen any of these first five. Lastly is what's called micro evolution. I object to the term, but they use it So I'll use it micro evolution tells us there are varieties within the same kind big dogs little dogs Okay, this one happens The first five are purely religious and if you want to believe in those first five you enjoy yourself But don't call it science and don't make me pay to teach that to the next generation of kids as part of science because it's Not it's nothing but a religion So according to the evolution theory 20 billion years ago Big Bang 4.6 billion years ago the earth cooled down He rained on the rocks for millions of years turned him into soup and the soup came alive three billion years ago So great great great great great great. Great. Grandpa was soup. Okay Evolution is a dying religion surviving only on tax dollars evolution theory is positively anti science There's not a shred of real evidence to support any of the theories except off repeats and lies Let's define one more term in my last 30 seconds stupid Lacking normal intelligence foolish silly a stupid idea dull and boring Evolution is not even a good theory.

You're gonna tell me that back in the Ice Age, how much taxes did people pay and how many changes did governments make to melt the ice? The climate is going to continue to change and there is no reason to just open up our borders and allow everyone in and continue to funnel over 50 billion dollars or however many billions of dollars or trillions of dollars to foreign countries all over the world simply because they don't like the climate change. So there have been at least five or more Ice Ages over the course of the history of the earth. You know, there was one five million years ago, 2.5 million years ago. The most recent Ice Age was about 24-25,000 years ago. And the Homo sapiens, the humans that existed at that time, were, you know, the Neanderthals, the Denis Chauvins, a very early form of man. And I don't think they were, like, taxing. You know, I don't think they had taxes. I don't think they were, like, levying taxes because they were, you know, they were Neanderthals and such. And just trying to survive, you know, the Ice Age. So during the Ice Age, they wouldn't have had any taxes, Marjorie. Yeah. You moron. And then also on the whole subject of, like, you know, we shouldn't open up our borders. So here's the thing. The borders of the United States are not open. There's like a little border there. You have to come through it to come into the United States. That's not happening. But the reason that people are collecting at the border, right? One of the reasons that what's drawing them here is that climate change, despite the fact the earth being tens of millions of years old, in the most recent era, in the last few hundred years that you're starting to see the destruction of the climate, that's us. That's the things that we're doing, drilling for oil and, you know, dragging oil up out of the center of the earth. The things that we're doing are changing the climate that has been, you know, surviving. You know, this earth has survived a really long time before we started impacting it with our technology and the things we're doing. But the things we're doing are impacting it. And one of the reasons that people are actually being drawn here is the climates in which they live become unbearable, right? The soil gets untillable. Farming and agriculture becomes almost impossible because of the changes in the climate. And when places become unlivable, unbearable, people move. That's how your people, your ancestors got here, Marjorie. Europeans who found the circumstances and the climate in which they lived in Europe, whether because of religious persecution or because of things like famine, you know, the Irish, it was famine that drove them to move, to come here. How do you think white people got here, to here, to North America? They were driven to move because of changes in the climate in which they lived. People move when they find their circumstances unbearable. That's just what humans do. Ancient humans, modern humans, it's kind of a human thing, right? And so it is a good idea for us to work with countries around the world to try to help improve the climate. Because if we do give money, let's say to countries that are suffering climate catastrophes, and they can shore up the climates, the climate in their own countries where they live, fewer people will move. See, that is a solution. You see, so it's the opposite of what you're saying. And also, who is electing these people? How are y'all letting them get into office? I truly, genuinely don't understand it. It really doesn't make any sense. But I just want to close by saying Ice Age, lots of Neanderthals, lots of early humans, early Homo sapiens, not a lot of taxes, no government that we know of. And people move because the climate becomes unbearable. It's just logic. It's how white people, Europeans got here. And then they brought along a bunch of people that they enslaved. Because you know, the climate wasn't bearable in the places where they wanted to grow cotton and such. You see how climate works? And makes people do all kinds of things. Marjorie, okay, you go on now and be blessed. And have a nice, a nice day. Oh, y'all, you gotta vote for better people. Lord have mercy.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

What I can tell you is that climate change is real. We got to do something about it. Yeah, this one's called autumn, sir. Sorry? This one's called autumn right now. So yeah. I'm sorry, I couldn't make out what you said, sir. This climate change right now is called autumn. Yes. Yeah, that's that's the seasons changing, which respectively is not the same thing as the climate changing. Yeah. For those who don't know, it is now the year 2023 and still, still Republican politicians like Representative Doug LaMoffa are pretending that climate change doesn't exist. Like I'm sorry, but just this year, Phoenix reached 110 degree temperatures for 30 days in a row. Maui's droughts set the stage for a devastating wildfire, and Southern California experienced a tropical storm for the first time in nearly a century. Which is to say nothing of the sheer devastation wrought by other once-in-a-century storms that miraculously managed to hit the U.S. multiple times every single year. But sure, that must all just be AUTUMN. I'm sorry, but give me a fucking break. And if this tired, desperate climate denialism looks familiar, that's because Republicans have been pulling these same tired stunts for years. Here's Republican Senator Jim Inhofe almost a decade ago making the same inane suggestion. Sure, these last eight years have all been the hottest years on record, but guys, there's a snowball, so who can really say? And clearly things haven't gotten any better. Here's Republican Senator Ron Johnson only days ago. These people are telling sub-Saharan Africa, you have to stay in the dark and not develop your fossil fuels because we say so. This is keeping a billion people in the dark, Senator, because they say so. It's essentially climate colonialism. It's racist. Degan, there are 1,600 scientists from around the world that just joined in a declaration led by two Nobel laureates that said we are not in a climate emergency, that all this climate change alarmism is based on bad science, completely ignoring the impact of clouds to basically be a heat sink. Again, the climate has always changed, always will. I'm not alarmist. I'm not in denial, but we've spent over $5 trillion globally on climate change. We haven't moved the needle, according to climate alarmists. How much more are we going to waste? These windmills, according to an earlier report on your network, are killing the whales. Again, this whole climate change agenda is driven toward control over our lives. It's economically destructive. It's why we are experiencing inflation and high energy prices. That's all this president is focused on. See guys, you might think there are record temperatures just because our thermometers might say so, but let's not forget about the clouds. And that's to say nothing of the fact that windmills, which are positioned in the sky, are killing the whales, which are located in the oceans. Make sense? No? Well maybe you should do your own research. And let's be clear, the reason for this bad faith bullshit is obvious. Republicans are pretending that climate change isn't real because they are getting paid to. These people aren't dumb, they're liars, sure, but they're not dumb. They can see the impacts of climate change. They can see the record heat. They can see the record wildfires. They can see the record hurricanes. They can see the record droughts. But Republicans have received over $310 million from oil and gas companies who stand to benefit from entrenching the status quo. When we switch from oil and gas to renewables and clean energy, who do you think that impacts? The Exxons and BPs of the world. But those companies know that all it takes for some bad faith climate denialism is a few thousand dollars to some spineless Republican politicians and Democratic politicians in fairness, although not even close to the sheer quantity of those on the right, and then those people will come out and pretend that a once-in-a-century storm is just called AUTUMN. Take Doug LaMalfa himself, the guy who suggested to Pete that climate change is nothing more than the changing of the seasons. He took about $9,000 from oil and gas companies this cycle. It cost just $9,000 for him to peddle this pathetic, shameless, embarrassing bullshit to the entire world. $9,000 to sell out the planet that his kids and grandkids will inherit. $9,000 to play make-believe because that is how bought and sold this guy and his party are. Doug LaMalfa sold every ounce of his integrity for the price of a used Honda Civic. But in spite of the GOP's tired theatrics, just know that the Democrats are barreling forward with an agenda that actually confronts the impacts of climate change. Just TODAY Biden announced a new climate corps that will train more than 20,000 young people in skills crucial to combating climate change, including the installation of solar panels, restoring coastal wetlands, and retrofitting homes to be more energy efficient. And all participants in the program will be paid. According to the White House, the administration will specifically be focused on making sure that folks that are coming through this program have a pathway into good-paying union jobs. We are very keenly focused on that. And this is hardly the White House's only move on climate. The White House also championed and signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the biggest climate investment in history. That legislation alone has created more than 170,000 clean energy jobs, while projected to create more than 1.5 million additional jobs over the next decade. Private sector companies have announced over $110 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments in just the last year alone, and $240 billion since Biden was elected. This law will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1 billion tons in 2030, keeping us on track to cut emissions by over 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and on track to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050. According to the Department of Energy, US electricity generation from wind is expected to triple, and solar generation is expected to increase as much as 8-fold by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act also includes over a billion dollars in funding to help protect vulnerable communities from drought, heat, and extreme weather, and will help regular American families save between $27 and $38 billion on their electricity bills. And of course, the US is now building a nationwide EV charging network, all the while EV sales have tripled during Biden's presidency. So I really don't know how to sugarcoat this, and frankly, I REALLY don't give a shit if I sound alarmist, but vast swaths of this planet will and already are becoming inhabitable because of the impacts of climate change. Young people know this, scientists know this, and everyone else willing to acknowledge objective reality knows this. The GOP and the media can both size this thing into oblivion, but the debate is over. This administration and today's Democratic Party understand that, and they are working to fix it. The danger in allowing Republicans to take power cannot be overstated. We have an ever-shrinking window where we can save this planet. We're taking the most aggressive action that's ever been taken, but that will END the SECOND Republicans have the ability to do so. And then the government will be run by assholes like Doug LaMalfa, who will equate the FALL equinox with record temperatures for 8 straight years across the globe. If you're a Republican voter, think about that. If you're a non-voter, think about that. If you have kids and want to make their lives easy and enjoyable, think about that. This issue should transcend politics. It is existential for us as humans who share this planet. But the fact that Republican politicians will gladly politicize it for just a few thousand bucks from oil and gas companies should be all the proof you need that their priority isn't us, it is their jobs and their own grip on power.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

Not a cough or a wheeze from any of them. This doesn't kill anybody, this doesn't make anybody cough. This is not a health event. This has got nothing to do with climate. First off, this is wildfire smoke, this is natural. This is not because of climate change. It's not because of fossil fuel, you know, internal combustion engines. This is crazy, this is all particulate matter, but particulate matter was not a concern until EPA invented it as one in the 1990s, and they've been riding it in the Obama administration, now the Biden administration. Well, what is it? Is it a health concern? No, particulate matter is very fine soot. Well, you don't wanna be breathing that in all day. They're just carbon particles, they're innocuous. Okay, they're innocuous, there's nothing in them. They have no effect. EPA has all this testing on real-life human beings. It shows no effect.

So when the Sun rotates around this side of the earth for 12 hours They experience daytime and this is exactly what this would look like on the flat earth model And this is why we see angled Sun rays because the Sun is actually a lot smaller and closer to the earth Just literally common sense. I'm gonna explain the seasons take notice of this part of the map So this is the December Solstice where the Sun rotates on the outer perimeter of our earth, which looks like this So all the people in the middle would experience winter and this is the June Solstice where the Sun is rotating more towards the North Pole which looks like this So all the people in the middle experience summer and you have fall which is in between summer and winter So this is the North Pole as the seasons change the Sun starts to rotate more south and you can prove this by yourself Through observation with your own two eyes I live in Canada in the summer the Sun would set in front of my house and in the winter time It would set much further south over the lake I observe it every single day and see it move gradually and gradually further away and it would get gradually colder and colder and colder Now they are lying to you because they are hiding God's true creation and they do not want you knowing how divine you are Look within for the real answers.

Is climate change going to end life as we know it? Are we all just going to burst into flames? Are our cities going to be swallowed by the seas? Is it going to become so hot that we're just going to melt? We got fires in Canada! Well what if I told you that maybe, just maybe, some of that fear is being pushed by the fossil fuel industry? I hold in my hands a leaked strategy document prepared by Canada's most infamous PR firm, Navigator. And it's just like, straight up evil. Now if you don't know who Navigator is, let's just say that the phrase, I hired Navigator, usually translates into, I'm guilty and I'm going to get away with it. Their slogan says it all, when you can't afford to lose. This strategy document was prepared in 2018 for an unnamed fossil fuel client. And it details a command and control campaign to poison public opinion against a proposed climate regulation called the Clean Fuel Standard. And the only reason why I have this is because someone with a conscience leaked it to Greenpeace. So thanks unnamed PR employee that's probably fired or maybe killed by now. They propose three pillars in their campaign. The first two are just about how big the campaign needs to be. But the third one is creepy. Fighting climate change is a losing battle. Oh, it costs too much. Oh, what about the jobs? Oh, other countries are doing way less. Do you like to do anything about it anyway? We're all dead. And as someone who talks about climate change online, it's uncanny to see all of these ideas parroted at me in my comment section every day, just every single day. The truth is giving up on fighting climate change only benefits one group of people. Ultra rich sociopaths who hire people like Navigator to hack people's brains so they can keep profiting off the destruction of the planet. You know, this planet, the only one in the known universe that can harbor complex life. But there is some good news. The Clean Fuel Standard, that regulation I talked about that this whole thing was designed to fight, it passed. These people are not invincible. Far from it. But if we truly want to fight climate change, we do have to end life as we know it. This life, this unsustainable sh** life where they're in charge and we're pushed harder and harder to work for less money just so that they can make line always grow line go up because unsustainable ends one way or another. It's time we build a sustainable economy, one that helps both people and planet thrive. And if you want to learn more about how we make that happen, follow along.'''\n        ", "completion": "0"}

She tweeted in a curiously deleted tweet, a top climate scientist, how dare you? She said, a top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years. To be fair to Greta, she did not say that the world would end in five years. She said that climate change would wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years. And those are different claims, but the practical consequence of them is pretty similar. Whether we're already dead or merely inevitably doomed, there is now, according to Greta Thunberg, absolutely no reason to try to do anything about so-called climate change. It's too late.
